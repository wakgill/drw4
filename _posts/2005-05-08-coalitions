title: ArcticAvengers + coalition groups
---

Some ArcticAvengers members have been asking my plans for [coalitions](https://cityofheroes.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_Notes/2005-05-04) with other supergroups.

We're already partnered with Atlas Avengers but I definitely want to find other groups. The challenge will be finding ones that are as active and organised as us.

Related to this though, I'm excited to announce that we will be making use of the coalition feature as part of our expansion goals. As you know, the limit on members controls our growth potential. I'm forced to make tough decisions like kicking people out for inactivity. I used to do this once a month at most, but lately I've been doing it if people are not active for a week. Some people have gotten mad at this but the demand is high and the group is only fun if its active.

To fix this, I'll be creating several new sub-supergroups that will help us get past the current limit. 

Arctic Avengers Training Academy will be a group for new heroes. All new invites will have to join this for a period of time to prove their activity level.

Arctic Avengers Reserve will be for alt characters of existing active members. Unless you're very active on two accounts, I'd like to move alts to that group.

Arctic Avengers Elite will be for level 50 characters that are no longer active. You don't need to move there if you're 50 and have been a longtime member, but please do!

I'm also thinking of making a Arctic Avengers Spec-Ops group which will be a fun spinoff of the main group but no official plans yet.

All of these groups will be added as a coalition group to the main one so we'll be able to share bases and chats.
