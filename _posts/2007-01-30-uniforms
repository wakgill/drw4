title: ArcticAvengers uniform policy and schedule
---

A lot of people have asked me about having an "official" ArcticAvengers uniform. I guess I'm not doing my job communicating well because we already have one and several members have it!

It's not mandatory, though its strongly encouraged. The uniform is my primary costume. That sexy blue and white you've all seen win every costume contest ever. The spikey blue hair is not part of the uniform, and mask is optional too. Most members have their own as their secondary costume and use it only during task forces, missions or social events.  For example, we recently participated in a supergroup costume contest...and easily won!

Feel free to copy my costume if you want a uniform, and I can give feedback if you're struggling to get it right. I'll also be holding monthly sessions at the tailor in Steel Canyon for people who want my help. I'll announce times later, and when I get a chance, I'll write up a short guide to the uniform as well.

I think it'd be neat to get as many members using the uniform as possible. Helps with recruitment.

Oh! I almost forgot. My shoulder pads are part of the Good vs Evil Edition of COH. It's like 10 dollars to upgrade and you will get access to them. You can also use the alternate varient I'll add to the guide if you don't want to pay. That's fine!
