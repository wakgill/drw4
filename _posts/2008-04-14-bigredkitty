title: How to be an unkillable Beastmastery Hunter

These videos by BigRedKitty changed the way I fight as a Hunter. It's all about the jump shot and your ability to attack the enemy while running away.

I recommend mastering the run, jump, turn, and spin on your own before you try them out on world monsters or PvP, and keep in mind that you might need a better mouse for this than the one your computer came with. It didn't take me that long but since getting it down I've been all but unstoppable in Alterac Valley.
