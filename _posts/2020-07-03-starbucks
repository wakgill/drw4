title: Starbucks' 'pay it forward' considered harmful
excerpt: It's not that I'm against buying someone's drinks. In fact, I've often paid for people in lines or at restaurants who are, for example, having their cards declined. I don't mind that, and while I don't consider it a significant virtue, it creates maybe a tiny bit more happiness for both parties and that's a good thing. But I'm against imposing unchosen obligations upon a stranger. I don't want the person I just paid for to be guilted by a smiling barista into paying for drinks that might be much more expensive than their own.

Have you ever had someone pay for your Starbucks drink in the drive-through line only to be asked by a glowing barista to pay for the drinks of the car behind you?

It's informally called 'pay it forward,' and its gotten a lot of news coverage as a beautiful display of goodwill and altruism towards your fellow coffee-drinker. One news outlet tells us that over [137 people](https://www.wqad.com/article/news/local/outreach/pay-it-forward/hundreds-of-starbucks-customers-pay-it-forward-at-drive-thru/526-60b6cded-2407-4004-92c8-7eb60a806870#:~:text=April%2019%2C%202017-,BETHEL%20PARK%2C%20Pennsylvania%E2%80%93%20A%20single%20random%20act%20of%20kindness%20started,for%20the%20car%20behind%20them.) paid for eachother's drinks! Another one hit nearly [400!](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/08/21/378-people-pay-it-forward-at-fla-starbucks/14380109/)

It sure sounds nice. Bob pays for Jill. Jill pays for Carl. Carl pays for Alice. I almost feel good about myself just thinking about it. What an easy way to get your virtue-fix for the day!

Well, it's not nice at all, you shouldn't do it, and I always find myself having to be the asshole in line who ends it. I don't, and won't, pay for the drinks in the car behind me if I find myself caught in one of these ridiclous virtue orgies.

No, it's not that I'm against buying someone's drinks. In fact, I've often paid for people in lines or at restaurants who are, for example, having their cards declined. I don't mind that, and while I *don't* consider it a significant virtue, it creates maybe a tiny bit more happiness for both parties and that's a good thing. But I'm against imposing unchosen obligations upon a stranger. I don't want the person I just paid for to be guilted by a smiling barista into paying for drinks that might be much more expensive than their own. 

For example, the first time I encountered a 'pay it forward' line, I happily discovered my $2.45 green tea had been paid for by a generous stranger in front of me. "Great! Why did they do that?" I asked the barista. She told me it was "a thing everyone was doing" and asked if I would "like to buy drinks for the car behind" me. I naively agreed to pay and only then realised that the car would cost me $10.50. Fine for me, albiet a bit annnoying, because I can afford that, but can everyone in line afford playing this game so that the car in front of them and the baristas can feel good about themselves? I doubt it. 

People from all sorts of backgrounds and income levels go through Starbucks every day and I have no idea what the person in the car behind me is dealing with or what they're comfortable paying for. And while it's true they can always say "no, thank you" (I do now!), there's a weird unspoken social pressure to *not be that guy.* I know because I've felt it. You feel like you've got to pay or you'll spoil the fun. You'll be the selfish jerk who took a free drink and didn't help anyone else.

There's nothing "nice" about doing that to someone. You've just put them in a very awkard situationâ€”join the virtue orgy, even if you can't afford it, or feel bad yourself and risk the ugly eye of the barista you've just offended.

So the buck stops with me whenever someone pays for me. I didn't ask for it and I certainly don't have the right to pressure someone else. If you want to buy drinks for someone, just do it and shut up about it.
