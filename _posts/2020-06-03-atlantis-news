Dark net markets have thrived since June 2011 when Adrian Chen published his famous Gawker article proving that Silk Road 1 was, contrary to my assumption when it was announced in January/February 2011, not a scam and was a fully-functional drug market, a new kind dubbed “dark net markets” (DNM). Fascinated, I soon signed up, made my first order, and began documenting how to use SR1 and then a few months later, began documenting the first known SR1-linked arrests. Monitoring DNMs was easy because SR1 was overwhelmingly dominant and BlackMarket Reloaded was a distant second-place market, with a few irrelevancies like Deepbay or Sheep and then the flashy Atlantis.

This idyllic period ended with the raid on SR1 in October 2013, which ushered in a new age of chaos in which centralized markets battled for dominance, the would-be successor Silk Road 2 was crippled by arrests and turned into a ghost-ship carrying scammers, and the multisig breakthrough went begging. The tumult made it clear to me that no market or forum could be counted on to last as long as SR1, and research into the DNM communities and markets, or even simply the memory of their history, was threatened by bitrot: already in November 2013 I was seeing pervasive myths spread throughout the media—that SR1 had $1 billion in sales, that you could buy child pornography or hitmen services on it, that there were multiple Dread Pirate Roberts—and other dangerous beliefs in the community (that use of PGP was paranoia & unnecessary, markets could be trusted not to exit-scam, that FE was not a recipe for disaster, that SR2 was not infiltrated despite the staff arrests & even media coverage of a SR1 mole, that guns & poison sellers were not extraordinarily risky to purchase from, that buyers were never arrested).

And so, starting with the SR1 forums, which had not been taken down by the raid (to help the mole? I wondered at the time), I began scraping all the new markets, doing so weekly and sometimes daily starting in December 2013. These are the results.

## Missing

I discovered during the research that I'm likely missing several later newsletter issues. Roy Halliday, the source, wrote that he stopped subscribing in 1971. Unfortunately I cannot know how many issues I'm missing or their importance. The newsletter ends sometime after 1971.

They’re going to build an island, baby, in the middle of the ocean
