## Chapter 1: Hermarianne

Craig, Calvin and Hermarianne slammed the door with as much force as the three of them could muster.

"That was fucking close," Craig said, panting. "Yeah," Calvin agreed. His jean shorts were soaked with sweat and his #CraigISSatoshi tank-top looked like it had been torn by some kind of wild animal.

"Who the fuck keeps a three-headed dog in a school?" Craig asked. "Anyone who read Lester and Cohen back in the 90s knows that's illegal. Fucking anarchists."

Calvin was about to speak when he was interrupted by Hermarrianne.

"Well, I'm going to bed before either of you get us killed, or worse expelled!" she yelled.

But she didn't move. Craig and Calvin stared back. "Okay? Goodnight?"

"Well?" Hermarianne asked, visibily frustated. "Which one of you is joining me tonight?"

But Craig had a dozen papers to write and several patents to file before sunrise and Calvin reminded her she wasn't really his type.

## Chapter Two: Nickolas Sznape

Professor Nickolas Sznape stood at the front of the room, looking criminally. 

“There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don’t expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. However, for those select few who possess, the predisposition…I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death.”

Craig’s hand shot up.

“What is it, Wright?” Sznape asked, irritated.

“I actually have a patent on the Death Stopper™.”

“What?”

“And the Bottle Fame™. Brewing Glory™ is pending but I wrote a paper on that way back in the 90s with a coffee stain and rusty staples to prove it when I was doing my third master’s program in chemical….”

“You impertinent boy!“ Sznape interrupted, seething.

“What’s to stop me from suing you if you teach the students these formulas?” Craig asked?

“What…can you show me these patents?”

“I don’t need to prove anything to you here. That is what courts are for. I will demonstrate it to the Ministry of Magic, not here. But if you mix those potions now, I bankrupt you. ”

Sznape considered Craig’s threat, then continued with the lesson and instructed the students to turn to page 45 of their textbook.

Craig’s hand shot up again. 

Sznape ignored it. “Tell me students, what do you get when you cross wormwood with…”

“I recently registered the copyright to that essay. That book is plagiarizing me.”

The students and Sznape watched aghast as the author’s name on the page slowly faded out and was replaced by “Craig Stephen Wright, Order of Merlin, First Class, Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot……” the titles ran off the page.

“And Wormwood is a Schedule 1 drug. In 2003 I did work for the Ministry of Magic Office of..”

“Will you shut up!” Sznape screamed

“…Controlled Magical Substances and I will see you bent over by the Dementors in Azkaban before I let you turn my formulas into crime potions.’

Before a stunned Sznape could respond, Craig stormed out of the room, followed by a couple of the best students and all of the worst, to start his own potions class.

## Chapter Three: The Mirror

Craig and Calvin stood before the Mirror of Erised. “My God,” Calvin said. “Craig, it’s you, writing the BitCoin™ white paper.”

Craig’s eyes flicked greedily over to the mirror. “So it is….” He paused to take the image in. “I remember reading it, and was very impressed by it.”

Calvin looked over at Craig, confused.

“Probably when I wrote it.” Craig finished calmly.

“But this shows what you want most in the world, not what you have now,” Calvin said. “How could it show that if you’d written it yourself?”

Craig sighed. “The Mirror was bewitched by Greg Maxwell to show you that, and to hide his crimes from the world. It doesn’t show us what we want. It slanders us with the thing that hurts most. For me, that is denying me my rightful claims to BitCoin.™”

“I don’t understand,” Calvin said.

“Here, stand in front of the mirror for yourself,” Craig said patiently. “It will work the same for you.”

Calvin moved in front of the mirror then recoiled and quickly stepped away.

“What did you see?” Craig asked. “I didn’t get a chance to look.”

“Uh..” Calvin was red. “It’s nothing. You’re right, the mirror is clearly bewitched to show us something we don’t actually want, no doubt by Greg Maxwell as you said. You are Satoshi,” Calvin said.

“See?” Craig said.

And Calvin muttered something under his breath that Craig couldn't hear as he and Craig left the room.
