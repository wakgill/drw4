title: The Great Bitcoin Scaling Debate — An Annotated Timeline
date: 2020-06-20
---

This is a long, working document that is nowhere near complete. I attempt to show through a chronology of primary source material that Bitcoin was systematically hijacked and directed against its original vision of scaling on-chain. 

I do not claim that scaling on-chain is the proper way to scale Bitcoin, only that it was the way *intended* by Satoshi Nakamoto and early Bitcoiners, and that technical and economic arguments against scaling on-chain played a less important role in the eventual outcome than censorship, propaganda, etc.

#### 29 October 1995

In a discussion about Digicash on the Cypherpunk Mailing List, 
James A. Donald [critisizes](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) 
the early electronic cash for having high fees.

>While Chaum is a brilliant cryptographer, he is an incompetent businessman
>
>He has demonstrated this in numerous ways.
>
>The latest being "Cash" where the bank skims off 4% to 10% every time.
>
>No one is going to use digicash under these kinds of terms and 
conditions.

#### 30 Oct 1995

Creator of the Cypherpunk Mailing List Timothy C. May [responds](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) 
in agreement.

>I don't know if the "skims off 4% to 10% every time" point accurately
describes how the current Digicash model works, but certainly this will not
fly as a long term rate. So many monetary transactions happen in the course
of business that even a 4% fee _per transaction_ would rapidly wipe out
most of the value.

#### 14 June 1996

Hal Finney argues for the [utility of online micropayments](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1996/06/b2345507ef1258011af9ea463ae9b03714f5cd29c4092458bd0002b360f1d545/) on the Cypherpunk Mailing List.

>Consider two sites, one which acts as a proxy and cache but which
charges something under a penny per page, and another which acts for
free.  Won't the for-pay site be able to afford a larger disk, more
servers, and better net connections?  It will be a superior service.
>
>Micropayments will allow new services and improved quality over what we
have today where we have to rely on charity and advertising as
motivations for much of what we find on the web.

#### 02 May 1997

Blockstream founder and Hashcash inventor Adam Back [writes](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1997/05/ef17e389556d2b6e27e8e0036a85ce1fedc73e2de871cc30728e7fc8be3d7f09/) 
on the Cypherpunk Mailing List that a successful digital cash project must be ultra low cost to transact with.

>What we want is fully anonymous, *ultra low transaction cost,* transferable units of exchange.  If we get that going the banks will become the obsolete dinasaurs they deserve to become.

#### May 1999

Nick Szabo publishes [*Micropayments and Mental Transaction Costs.*](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/micropayments-and-mental-transaction-costs.pdf) The paper argues against the viability of online micropayments and suggests security is a more important investment than reducing network resource usage to enable cheaper transactions.

>A lesson for micropayment efforts is that mental costs usually exceed, and
often dwarf, the computational costs. Reductions in the per transaction computational costs of transactions may often be economically insignificant. Other transaction costs addressable by hardware or software, such as security concerns,
as well as costs of better communicating product quality versus price tradeoffs
in the user interface, are usually more important ob jectives for technological
cost reduction than conserving on computational or network resources.

#### ~ 2002

Sometime in 2002 (exact date unknown), Nick Szabo publishes [*Shelling Out -- The Origins of Money.*](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/shell.html) The paper presents a theory of the beginnings of money that would later come to dominate part of the future Bitcoin community.

#### 22 January 2006

Future Blockstream Cofounder Greg Maxwell is [accused of vandalism, bullying, terrorist sympathizing, sockpupettry and more on Wikipedia.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/45ail1/wikipedians_on_greg_maxwell_in_2006_now_cto_of/)

>(Copied from WP:AN/3RR, because there were edits that amounted to vandalism, as well as excessive reverting)
>
>He has reverted Template:User freedom seven times despite repeated calls to stop from multiple editors. The version he is reverting to is far different from what the creators and users intended it for. I consider these edits to be an act of vandalism.

>I'm also surprised by the length of the block, because he was engaged in vandalism, not just edit warring. I'd block him myself but I was involved in a dispute with him over an image recently. Three examples of the edits I see as vandalism: he changed a box supporting the American military to one supporting the Iraqi insurgents. He inserted an image of a woman "hogtied" and gagged into a box opposing fox hunting, and changed the fox hunting link to BDSM. On Template:Wikiproject Terrorism, he replaced the image of a terrorist with one of a nuclear explosion.  

>Alert to all admins. Gmaxwell is going around to every user page that displays any kind of thumbnail or flag from Wikipedia Commons and declaring them "copyright violation". He is then blanking the user page and putting up a copyright violation notice. Is there any justification for this?

>Yes, I inadvertently fell foul of that a while ago. On that occasion, though, the person who alerted me merely removed the image and left me a polite note in explanation. Gmaxwell has for some time been behaving very oddly and aggressively with regard to image violations (real or occasionally imagined). Here, he's misapplying a rule about fair-use images to the use of public-domain images, and doing so in a heavy-handed manner.

>I've spoken to him several times about his aggression, since a dispute I had with him recently about an image (in which he called me "hysterical" and accused me of vandalism because I dared to revert his removal of it). What with this today and his behavior last night (see above), I'm unsure of the best way is to proceed, but something needs to happen.

>His behaviour is outrageous. Firstly, where fairuse images are wrongly on user pages it is invariably due to a misunderstanding, not an attempt to break the law. All he had to do was leave a message, not post a massive notice all but accusing the user of being a lawbreaker. Secondly, he is not removing the offending image, but all images, even those that can be displayed. Thirdly, blanking a user's page is grossly disrespectful to other users. Frankly, he is out of control at this stage. This bullying behavour of his has to stop.

>I move that all his edits be reverted and considered petty vandalism, and that the said user be blocked for a period of one week. We don't have time to entertain him or his dubious edits.

>OK, his contribs list is beyond the pale. It's vandalism, pretty clearly.

>On the evidence, it seems that Majorityrule was a sockpuppet of Gmaxwell. I have extended Maxwell's block to one week. Given his behaviour, if they are an admin perhaps a move should be made to have them desysoped.

>He isn't an admin and supeficially performing exactly the same set of edits does suggest a sock puppet (my initial reaction), though of course it's possible that it is someone up to mischief.

>He's not known for making "reasonable, patient attempts to protect the Foundation," unfortunately, but for acts of aggression that have led other users to leave the project. I'm concerned that, in his most recent statements, he has announced his intention to continue being disruptive, and has said he'll evade any blocks that are applied. That's a direct threat to the project, not an attempt to protect it.

>Today he seemed to indicate he has no intention of following our policies:
>
>"Like I give a crap about being blocked, it doesn't even inhibit me from editing."
>
>"Man. You think I've stopped because I'm blocked? Please! Blocking doesn't actually stop anyone but twits!" 
>
>"You're still wrong about me being blocked accomplishing *anything*, since I can still edit whenever I please... in fact, being blocked gives me far less incentive to be nice about it, in so far as there can be far less than nearly none at all."
>
>"I feel great because I can still do what I want, and I don't have to worry what rude jerks think about me ... I can continue to do whatever I think is right without the burden of explaining myself to a shreaking [sic] mass of people." 
>
>That's not even to mention the personal attacks.

>My opinion of this user is that he is a very dangerous individual whose edits speak for themselves. Full of sarcasm, threats, rude insults, impersonations of an admin, not to mention massive disprect of other users and blanking of user pages. I'm all about forgiving, but this is banable behavior. If further incidents occur, a ban would be warranted. 

#### 16 April 2008

Early Bitcoin code generated by Satoshi prior to the release of Bitcoin shows [scraps of code for an online poker game,](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/1/tree/trunk/uibase.cpp) suggesting Satoshi intended from the start that Bitcoin would be useable for small online payments.

#### 14 February 2010

Satoshi deletes what appears to be unfinished rudimtentary code for a p2p marketplace in a commit labeled ["strip out unfinished product, review and market stuff."](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/cc4b78d59f566ff43881f57797a16ce45eb1b80ez) Though the code was never finished, it suggests Satoshi intended for Bitcoin to be used in commerce early on.

Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn [commented](http://eigenjoy.com/2014/05/17/bitcoin-2014-amsterdam-day-two-notes/) on this years later.

>When Satoshi launched bitcoin he was working on a p2p marketplace and you would be able to rate buyers and sellers and the weight would be according to how much mining they had done. He realized there were more important priorities.

#### 14 July 2010

A <code>max_block_size</code> [value of 1MB](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/a30b56ebe76ffff9f9cc8a6667186179413c6349#diff-118fcbaaba162ba17933c7893247df3aR2614) set on the client.

#### 22 July 2010

The Bitcoin.org website on [Wayback Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20100722094110/http://www.bitcoin.org:80/) lists the main advantages of Bitcoin on the homepage. In bold, it says:

> Bitcoin transactions are practically free, whereas credit cards and online payment systems typically cost 1-5% per transaction plus various other merchant fees up to hundreds of dollars.

#### 19 September 2010

After some discussion, Hal Finney, Satoshi (Bitcoin’s creator), and the user ‘Cryddit,’ who is Ray Dallingerr, on Bitcointalk imposed a [1MB default block size](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/172f006020965ae8763a0610845c051ed1e3b522) to reduce the chance of spam transactions hijacking blockspace, or the possibility of cheap DoS attacks. [Cryddit below explains why this limit was put in place:](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=946236.msg10388435#msg10388435)

>I'm the guy who went over the blockchain stuff in Satoshi's first cut of the bitcoin code.  Satoshi didn't have a 1MB limit in it. The limit was originally Hal Finney's idea.  Both Satoshi and I objected that it wouldn't scale at 1MB.  Hal was concerned about a potential DoS attack though, and after discussion, Satoshi agreed.  The 1MB limit was there by the time Bitcoin launched.  But all 3 of us agreed that 1MB had to be temporary because it would never scale.
>
>Several attempted "abuses" of the blockchain under the 1MB limit have proved Hal right about needing the limit at least for launching purposes.  A lot of people wanted to piggyback extraneous information onto the blockchain, and before miners (and the community generally) realized that blockchain space was a valuable resource they would have allowed it.  The blockchain would probably be several times as big a download now if that limit hadn't been in place, because it would have a lot of random 1-satoshi transactions that exist only to encode information for altcoins etc.
>
>At this point I don't think random schmoes who would allow just any transaction are getting a  lot of blocks. The people who have made a major investment in hashing power are doing the math to figure out which tx are worthwhile to include because block propagation time (and therefore the risk of orphan blocks) is proportional to block size. So at this point I think blockchain bloat as such is no longer likely to a problem, and the 1MB limit is no longer necessary.  It has been more-or-less replaced by a profitability limit that motivates people to not waste blockchain bandwidth, and miners are now reliably dropping transactions that don't pay fees. 

#### 01 December 2010

One of the [earliest posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eef3h/a_short_introduction_to_bitcoin_a_peer_to_peer/) on r/Bitcoin is made linking to an article titlted *A Short Introduction to Bitcoin - A Peer to Peer Cryptocurrency.* The [linked article](https://bluishcoder.co.nz/2010/10/10/a-short-introduction-to-bitcoin.html) describes the author's interest in Bitcoin's ability to offer micropayments.

>I'm interested in the approach of using bitcoin as a way to do micro-transactions and ease online payments and donations.

#### 16 June 2011

The original threads about the Silk Road on BitcoinTalk are [revealed to have been deleted,](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=17872.0) one of the earlier examples of censorship in Bitcoin. 

#### 29 June 2011

One early Bitcoiner comments that the Bitcoin [forums are becoming a horrible place to discuss things](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=17872.msg304289#msg304289) because of moderators censoring old threads and trolls.

>forum.bitcoin.org is the single worst place on the internet to talk about bitcoin.
>
>Dissenting voices are regularly shouted down or dismissed as trolls. Moderators are now deleting longstanding threads of great interest. The worst part is, in bitcoin-forumland, the internet is nothing but America.

#### 19 July 2011

r/bitcoin moderator u/AtlasLGo is [accused](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30211.0) of trying to sell r/bitcoin. In the ensuing drama, someone contacts Reddit and he is removed along with three other mods we can see on the [WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20110530125818/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/new/) as late as May 2011.

Theymos becomes the new sole [moderator](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=30211.msg381922#msg381922) and refuses to allow the old ones back in. We see him as the sole moderator on the WayBack machine in [September 2011.](https://web.archive.org/web/20110927021847/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/new/)

Now former moderator u/edzillion [recounted](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/84djb8/did_theymos_purchase_rbitcoin_in_2011/dvqcdvp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) the story years later: 

>Atlas was basically inactive - it seemed the modding was going just fine (it was a very positive community in those early days) but then one day without any warning we were all kicked. It seems atlas was chatting with people over IRC and they were like how can you sell it? and he booted all the other mods in preparation for a sale.
>
>This caused a total shitstorm, as you can imagine, and the community basically shouted loud enough that the orig mod backed down and agreed to hand it over to whoever the community decided, which was theymos.
>
>Theymos wasn't much better - wouldn't re-add any of the kicked mods and held it alone himself on some kind of power trip. Things got quite unfriendly after that - partially because theymos is a typical angry asshole libertarian, and partially because the scene grew so much that it was hard to maintain a close community.
>
>After a while of lobbying to get back in and failing, I gave up on it but I still feel disabused by that situation. I put a lot of good work into making bitcoin and r/bitcoin what it is today. We were all crazy wide-eyed zealots back then shouting it from the rooftops. I figured I at least deserved some kind of explanation, let alone my modship (which, let's face it is a somewhat useful position in the btc world).

#### 30 July 2011

Greg Maxwell suggests that [Bitcoin can scale and remain decentralized.](https://web.archive.org/web/20140328052630/https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Talk:Scalability)

>When techies hear about how bitcoin works they frequently stop at the word "flooding" and say "Oh-my-god! that can't scale!". The purpose of this article is to take an extreme example, the peak transaction rate of Visa, and show that bitcoin could technically reach that kind of rate without any kind of questionable reasoning, changes in the core design, or non-existent overlays. As such, it's merely an extreme example— not a plan for how bitcoin will grow to address wider needs (as a decentralized system it is the bitcoin using public who will decide how bitcoin grows)— it's just an argument that shows that bitcoin's core design can scale much better than an intelligent person might guess at first.
>
>Dan rightly criticizes the analysis presented here— pointing out that operating at this scale would significantly reduce the decentralized nature of bitcoin: If you have to have many terabytes of disk space to run a "full validating" node then fewer people will do it, and everyone who doesn't will have to trust the ones who do to be honest. Dan appears (from his slides) to have gone too far with that argument: he seems to suggest that this means bitcoins will be controlled by the kind of central banks that are common today. His analysis fails for two reasons (and the second is the fault of this page being a bit misleading):
>
>First, even at the astronomic scale presented here the required capacity is well within the realm of (wealthy) private individuals, and certainly would be at some future time when that kind of capacity was required. A system which puts private individuals, or at least small groups of private parties, on equal footing with central banks could hardly be called a centralized one, though it would be less decentralized than the bitcoin we have today. The system could also not get to this kind of scale without bitcoin users agreeing collectively to increase the maximum block size, so it's not an outcome that can happen without the consent of bitcoin users.

#### 18 April 2013

Someone by the name of John Dillon (john.dillon892@googlemail.com) emails the bitcoin-development email list offering a $500USD reward to anyone who implements a transaction replacement-by-fee patch for Bitcoin.

John Dillon claimed in [leaked private emails](https://archive.is/PK1I1) that his day job is high up in a US intelligence agency. He says that he doesn't like what the government is doing and wants to make up for it by helping Bitcoin.

Peter Todd writes on BitcoinTalk that he is [considering claiming the bounty himself.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=179612.msg1873593#msg1873593)

In the thread about Replace-By-Fee, Justus Ranvier says Peter Todd is being [overly theoretical](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=179612.msg1879731#msg1879731) in his analysis of the dangers of zero-conf transactions.

>It's as if you've spent too much time playing The Sims and forget that both merchants and pool operators are sentient, intelligent beings instead of automatons.
>
>If the risks of zero conf double spends are worth expending resources to reduce or eliminate then the merchants will find a way to get it done. 

#### 17 May 2013

Peter Todd releases a highly downvoted video on why the [blocksize limit keeps Bitcoin free and decentralized](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=208200.0) that is [paid for](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=208200.msg2292636#msg2292636) by the psuednonymous US intelligence agent John Dillon according to [leaked emails.](https://archive.is/PK1I1)

<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/j58llpj0w6.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><div style="margin-bottom: 15px;" class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative; margin-bottom: 15px;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%; margin-bottom: 10px;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_j58llpj0w6 videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;position:relative;width:100%; margin-bottom: 10px;"><div class="wistia_swatch" style="height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%; margin-bottom: 10px;"><img src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/j58llpj0w6/swatch" style="filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%; margin-bottom: 15px;" alt="" aria-hidden="true" onload="this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;" /></div></div></div></div>

The YouTube responses are mostly negative and some are worth looking more at.

[Dan Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZp7UGgBR0I&lc=UggB-7XeRsy4y3gCoAEC) writes that the video is FUD designed to trick people with false equivocations.

>This is total FUD.  How can they equate 20 MB to needing huge centralized institutions.  Anyone in a first world nation living in an urban area can run a node even if we magically jumped to 20 MB right away (which won't happen).   How can someone be smart and creative enough to make a quality video like this not understand basic concepts is beyond me.

CarrolFilms points out that the [creator must have been bribed,](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1MNXlqOpPdm9iRK_trOePQ) which is in fact true.

>Who ever wrote this and made this must've been bribed to make this. It probably makes sense to those that are new to bitcoin, but for those that have an understanding can relate to the amount of crap this video is filled with.

Another user compares the block size limit to a [production quota.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwBccIoHJSKrEc8W0lyRwmw)

>Artificially limiting the block size, i.e. the network capability to process transactions is just plain and simple soviet quota control, the central planner that decides how many loafs of bread must be produced because otherwise "the bakers are too stupid to know, and they will run out of business".

Michael Meaden says it is [Orwellian propaganda.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRk_myJ7XEzB2ZoEc4IYDiA)

>Went from information to disinformation at 0:55, full cringe at 1:28, straight up Orwell at 2:28.

Responses to the video upon publication on BitcoinTalk largely agree the video is too dogmatic and radical. Some are worth looking at because they give us a good understanding of the strong arguments made in defense of moderate scaling at the time. 

Others show clearly that many people who would later argue for small blocks first argued for moderate scaling.

Future Blockstream Co-Founder Greg Maxwell writes that he is worried the video is overly [dogmatic and will make people falsely think the blocksize can't be raised at all.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=208200.msg2182597#msg2182597)

>I do cringe just a little at the over-simplification of the video...  and worry a bit that in a couple years it will be clear that 2mb or 10mb or whatever is totally safe relative to all concerns— perhaps even mobile devices with tor could be full nodes with 10mb blocks on the internet of 2023, and by then there may be plenty of transaction volume to keep fees high enough to support security—  and maybe some people will be dogmatically promoting a 1MB limit because they walked away from the video thinking that 1MB is a magic number rather than today's conservative trade-off.  200,000 - 500,000 transactions per day is a good start, indeed, but I'd certainly like to see Bitcoin doing more in the future.

He also argues that a blocksize restriction [makes Bitcoin worse for everyday payments](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=208200.msg2185876#msg2185876) and that the rise in fees has already turned people away from Bitcoin.

>Bitcoin as practical unit for common every days payment cheaply available to as many people as possible— practically any block size restriction is bad. It's also completely clear to me that transaction costs— even insubstantial ones— have already turned some people off from using Bitcoin. 

One Bitcoiner writes that the video paints a [totally dishonest picture of Bitcoin](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=208200.msg2185282#msg2185282) and that Peter Todd is so obsessed with tinkering and tesing that Bitcoin will never grow.

>The video is *completely dishonest from the point where data-centers is mentioned.* It makes the false case that up to 1MB blocks allow for decentralization and anything larger needs PayPal-like server farms for each node. It may be that the network would hum along fine with 2MB or 5MB blocks right now. We just don't know.

Another forum member points out that [small blocks will lead to centralization of on-chain Bitcoin payment processors,](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=208200.msg2185799#msg2185799) defeating the purpose of having decentralized validation of blocks.

>With your design, no more then 5 payment processors will have 80% share of all bitcoin transactions because this is how things work, you can take the clue practically from any other global market consolidation. So what is the point of having decentralized validation system if a user has to choose between 5 centralized solutions to make a transaction?

Solex warns that deliberately crippling Bitcoin's on-chain transaction throughput will lead to a small handful of banks controlling the transactions and hints that they might have a vested intererst in doing just that.

>In Peter's vision of the future those centralized solutions will all be Fidelity-bonded (Chaum-trusted) banks.

Edmund Edgar writes that [Bitcoin mining is competitive by nature](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=208200.msg2186414#msg2186414) and that if the competition leads to some mining centralization, that is a flaw of Bitcoin itself and not something that can be fixed by throttling it and keeping it as a hobby project.

>Bitcoin is designed to make mining a competitive market, so as more efficient miners show up, less efficient miners will constantly be finding that they can't operate at a profit and forced to close. The network connection for transmitting the blocks is a completely trivial factor compared to the raw economics involved in buying hardware and operating it to turn electricity into hash power more cheaply than anyone else.
>
>Centralization of mining power may turn out to be a serious problem, but if it is, it's a fundamental problem with the Bitcoin design, not something that you can prevent by throttling the network to 7 transactions per second. The only way throttling the network might help would be if it kills Bitcoin's growth and makes mining so unprofitable that only hobbyists bother with it.


#### 28 May 2013

In the ongoing discussion about the Peter Todd video, a forum member [points out](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=208200.msg2293256#msg2293256) that Peter Todd's limited blocks + high fees solution will lead to proprietary payment networks, a sort of PayPal 2.0 rather than what Bitcoin was intended to be.

>This is just my opinion, but I think the vast majority of people would prefer a fully automated p2p network that's made up of thousands of nodes operated by enterprises, than a fully automated p2p network with hundreds of thousands of nodes operated by hobbyists, but with the disadvantage that you need to trust third party payment processors for any kind of real world use of currency.

>If we're going to use proprietary networks (and they have to be networks to avoid expensive on-chain transactions) to transfer bitcoin credit, instead of bitcoin itself around, we can just use banks, or some successor to e-gold or something.
>
>Limiting Bitcoin to 7 tps in my opinion virtually guarantees it will never have significant impact, because I believe people will opt for government-regulated networks, or alternative blockchains, if Bitcoin, as a p2p network, loses its transaction fee advantage.

>The 1 MB cap was put in place as a temporary measure, until a better way to control transaction spam was found. Trying to make the limit permanent is trying to change the vision of Bitcoin as originally conceived.

Some of John Dillon's [emails leaked in an alleged hack.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=335658.0)

The emails prove that a US intelligence agent was instrumental in funding the video Peter Todd made about keeping the Bitcoin blocks small. He also asks about potentially hiring Peter Todd to implement some "important" Bitcoin features. Some selections from the leak are provided below.

>Please don't make this public, but my day job involves intelligence, and I'm in a relatively high position.

>To clarify Keep Bitcoin Free! is Peter's project, not mine. I only contributed funds and offered to let him use my name publicly as a supporter.

>I see that Peter Todd recently completed his audit report, even writing a small patch for Litecoin. Could you comment a bit on how that process went? I and someone else may want to hire him directly, as opposed to the bounties I've offered before, to implement some Bitcoin features and we want to get a sense of how it all went.

Peter Todd himself wrote that John Dillon creeped him out a bit and seemed to be obsessed with him.

>I know, I'll admit he kinda creeps me out a bit sometimes... he's admitted he reads all my posts.

The conclusion to draw is unclear. Was John Dillon actually an intelligence agent like he claimed? Was he trying to harm Bitcoin or help it? Mike Hearn writes ["I'm not sure what this "leak" is trying to prove"](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=335658.msg3615820#msg3615820) and indeed it's hard to draw any firm opinion other than the fact that the small-block video was indeed funded by a self-proclaimed agent of the state.

A user reported an issue on the Gentoo bug forum that a version of [bitcoind (the official reference client for interacting with the bitcoin network) distributed with Gentoo was blocking particular bitcoin addresses.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/524512)

Luke replies "no sign anything is actually broken here. Looks like just a troll. Status: INVALID or WORKSFORME?”

It turned out that Luke had quietly blacklisted the known addresses of several of the highest transaction-volume businesses in Bitcoin. At the time SatoshiDice in particular [was the most popular Bitcoin gambling site in the world.](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-company-acquisitions-begin-gambling-site-satoshidice-sells-for-11-5m-126315-btc)

In the later discussion on the bug forum, Dashjr called the businesses a [“DDoS attack on the bitcoin network“.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=524512#c7)

Another user rightly points out that this is nonsense and that the patch is censoring Bitcoin and [changing how users expect it to work.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/524512#c8)

>No, it's really not a DoS attack.

>
>There is nothing protocol-wise which is invalid about the transactions coming from the sources which are being blacklisted by this patch...

>... this patch is actively censoring and changing the behaviors of bitcoin to no longer act the usual way as defined by the the official non-patched defaults.

He later writes that [SatoshiDice is being punished for being too popular.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/524512#c6)

>Just to want to clarify on why the censorship is happening:
>
>The (alleged) attack in question is nothing more than a popular business model which has been attractive and actively used to the point where a non-small amount of traffic was generated by the sites in question.

>Paraphrased: "Too popular, and therefore there is a risk of the bitcoin network running out of capacity because of such business plans and their subsequent usage of bitcoin as a method for conducting business operations"

Luke later posted an apology and [removed the patch.](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=524512#c46)

#### 06 October 2014

Gavin Andresen [publishes a post](https://web.archive.org/web/20150130122517/https://blog.bitcoinfoundation.org/a-scalability-roadmap/) proposing that the 1MB limit be raised to allow for scalability.

He argues that the 1mb fix was always a temporary hack and that Satoshi always intended to raise the block size.

>Back in 2010, after Bitcoin was mentioned on Slashdot for the first time and bitcoin prices started rising, Satoshi rolled out several quick-fix solutions to various denial-of-service attacks. One of those fixes was to drop the maximum block size from infinite to one megabyte (the practical limit before the change was 32 megabytes– the maximum size of a message in the p2p protocol). The  intent has always been to raise that limit when transaction volume justified larger blocks.

He also writes that the expectation of Bitcoin holders from the start has always been that Bitcoin would scale up and that meeting those expectations is the same as meeting the expectation that Bitcoin would never increase the coin limit.

>I think the maximum block size must be increased for the same reason the limit of 21 million coins must NEVER be increased: because people were told that the system would scale up to handle lots of transactions, just as they were told that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins.

>As the Giga-blockchain and main-blockchain continue to grow from the fork, those actively attacking the Giga-Blockchain will create many transactions that allow their main-blockchain coins to duplicate over to the Giga-blockchain while remaining safely on the main-blockchain. The transactions that succeed can then be used to acquire more main-blockchain coins upon which the cycle repeats. Eventually the blockchain with the most financial resources behind it will continue to grow at a faster pace, while the other slowly, and eventually stops growing altogether.
>
>It will be impossible for the Giga-chain to keep 1:1 parity with the main chain from which it forks, they contain different transaction, although some may overlap. Here a user broadcasts a transaction with inputs originating on the Main-chain, and is eventually included in a block on the Giga-chain, but not on the Main-chain. The coin is essentially duplicated onto both chains.
>
>Those siding with the wrong chain who end up accepting duplicated transactions from the other chain, such as a purchase from an exchange running on the losing blockchain, will lose those coins when the dust settles. No war is without casulties, the Great Blockchain Civil War will be no different.

In response to Gavin Andresen's argument that Bitcoin's block size must be raised so more people can use it, Mircea Popescu writes in an unhinged rant that [Bitcoin is not for poor people.](http://trilema.com/2015/lets-address-some-of-the-more-common-pseudo-arguments-raised-by-the-very-stupid-people-that-like-the-gavin-scamcoin-proposal/)

>Bitcoin isn't for everybody...
>
>Should blocks ever become full, older coinbases will be prioritized over newer coinbases, and larger mining fees and transactions prioritized over smaller mining fees and smaller transactions. This means that someone who wishes to pay for very little with Bitcoin will be forced to use something else, so to speak is forced to "give his seat" to someone richer. This is exactly the point and the intent of Bitcoin : to force the poor to yield to the rich, unversally, as a matter of course.

Mike Hearn writes a popular article explaining why [letting the Bitcoin blocks get full would be devesating to adoption of Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@octskyward/crash-landing-f5cc19908e32) and trust in its future. He predits the rise of an altcoin market as businesses look for new options besides Bitcoin.

>But it would have lost critical momentum. It would have become the MySpace of digital currencies. The faithful would have lost a lot of faith, and businesses that were trying to bring Bitcoin to the mainstream would “pivot” towards something else. People who were motivated by Making The World A Better Place™ would conclude the ordinary people around them would never use their products, and so they’d leave.

>I believe there are no situations in which Bitcoin can enter an overload situation and come out with its reputation and user base intact. Both would suffer heavily and as Bitcoin is the founder of the cryptocurrency concept, the idea itself would inevitably suffer some kind of negative repercussions.

The move has support from Theymos, Cobra, Greg Maxwell, Peter Todd, Luke Dashjr, and others according to the Github thread.

![Position on Hard Forks](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/61096/8162837/d2c9b502-134d-11e5-9a8b-27c65c0e0356.png)

Developer Mike Hearn strongly cririsizes this as a move [towards centraliziation and thought control.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112121007)

>This is very disappointing David. You want to ensure new users don't learn about Bitcoin XT. Why not just say that outright?
>
>Your position is wrong and will just reduce bitcoin.org's utility as a place to learn important information.
>
>What's more, you are inherently supporting a status quo in which a tiny number of people can veto any change to Bitcoin regardless of how widely supported it is by the rest of the community. That's not decentralisation. And it is ultimately far more dangerous to Bitcoin. If you try and shut down the only method the community has to reject the decisions of this tiny group, you're effectively dooming the project to the whims of whoever happened to be around early on in the project and ended up with commit access.
>
>However, if you really want to "pick a side" in this debate like that, then given the wording of your policy if a >1mb chain wins you will have to replace Bitcoin Core completely and not mention it anywhere, as at that point, it would be the implementation leaving the consensus by attempting to produce a contentious hard fork (the 1mb only chain). So are you sure you thought this through? Are you ready for that pull request, if one day it comes?

Will Binns writes that this move will effectively [sway public opinion towards one side of the debate.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112123722)

>Bitcoin.org should try to say as non-bias as possible in the midst of publicly debated issues. Hundreds of people, if not thousands, are coming to this site every day, many of which are new users learning about Bitcoin for the first time. For existing users in the space, this website is also an incredible resource in most cases.
>
>It seems like this post would be in an effort to sway public opinion more-so than anything else. It doesn't provide a complete context nor link to a wider array of information about the underlying issues it references so the reader can form their own opinion - it comes across as forcing a biased one.

Mike Hearn comments again that the clever wording in this policy—"previous consensus—means that [almost all the major payment processors, exchanges, and wallets would need to be deleted](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112124088) in order to be consistent.

>Rereading the policy, there's one more reason this policy is suicide - it says you will delist any wallet or service that announces it will operate on the other side of the "previous consensus".
>
>Currently every single wallet bar GreenAddress that we've polled has told us they support bigger blocks.
>
>Additionally, every major payment processor we've talked to has also said that.
>
>Plus the major exchanges.
>
>So to be consistent with this policy you will have to delete every wallet and all major services (except GreenAddress) from the website. This would eliminate bitcoin.org as a useful place to learn about Bitcoin products and services, which is one of the key functions of the site!

He also correctly points out that raising the block size was always Satoshi's plan.

>I understand you are concerned about the notion of a contentious hard fork. I think you're wrong about the possible consequences though. It should be clear from the block chain when the change has reached a sufficient amount of mining power and at that point there would be plenty of time for services to upgrade before the fork actually happens. Nobody should lose any money and nobody should feel disenfranchised: they can just switch to the winning chain and carry on. They can always sell their coins before or after if they really believe that the plan Satoshi had all along is so bad.

After some back and forth, Mike concludes [the policy is entirely abitrary,](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/894#issuecomment-112136250) that most people support raising the blocksize including some Blockstream employees, and that not doing so will harm Bitcoin.

>Ah, so your policy is entirely arbitrary then.
>
>I can as well argue that in fact this situation is not contentious at all - as I said above, all major players agree on the need for larger blocks, indeed, even some Blockstream employees do (or say they do). It's really just a tiny number of people holding up progress at this point. So if you are going to decide that my definition of contentious is wrong and yours is right, just because "it's easy to say", then why have a policy at all? Why not just admit it's your opinion?
>
>Look. I don't mean to be antagonistic. I realise you are attempting to avoid harm to Bitcoin. But remember why Gavin and I are doing this - if the fork does not happen Bitcoin will suffer. You see this as some kind of one-sided deal: if a fork happens it might be bad and hurt Bitcoin, but if it doesn't happen there's no problem!
>
>I'm the developer of the first and still most widely used SPV wallets. Aaron Voisine is the developer of the most widely used SPV wallet on iOS. Both of us have reached the same conclusion about what will happen if capacity is not raised: it will hurt Bitcoin, a lot. Many others in the community have also reached that conclusion.

>By backing stasis you are not backing stability, or helping preserve Bitcoin's value. You are not taking a principled stand for a better development process. You are instead joining up with those who want to drive the network off a cliff. It is not bitcoin.org's place to make such decisions. Please reconsider this policy.

Another user comments that the censorship of Bitcoin XT topics is rallying the community to push back against them.

>The comically open and heavy-handed censorship combined with simple ad hominen attacks (XT is ALTCOIN) makes this feel almost like a troll campaign for the purpose of rallying the community.

Bitcoin entrepreneur Ryan Selkis asks Adam Back publicly if [he is seriously contemplating a class action lawsuit](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/633092083042099201?s=20) against Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen if they move forward with Bitcoin XT.

>@adam3us is it true you've contemplated joining a class action lawsuit against gavin & mike if they go through with the hard fork?

Adam Back [replies,](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/633093049397063680?s=20) seemingly acknowledging that he directly or indirectly supports the idea of a lawsuit to stop Bitcoin XT.

> if you lost your Bitcoins as a result of Gavin network split - would you hold him accountable?

He goes on to suggest that Gavin could be held [criminally negligent](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/633119949943275520?s=20) for supporting Bitcoin XT and compares him to Mark Karples of the infamous Mt. Gox exchange.

Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik [responds,](https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/633097876877348864?s=20) tagging Adam Back and Bitcoin Twitter personality Pierre Rochard, [who detailed](https://twitter.com/JackGavigan/status/698503931312394240?s=20) plans for a lawsuit in another Tweet:

>Turning to lawsuits implies you have lost both the tech argument and the community.

Cryptographer Ian Grigg [agrees.](https://twitter.com/iang_fc/status/633109258675073024?s=20)

>Turning to lawsuits recognises that we've lost the ability to consent as a community.

#### The same day

[Theymos announces a new censorship policy on r/Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/) that bans discussion of Bitcoin XT. The post should be read in full but some commentary is necessary.

1. Using Removeddit, [we can see that over 90 comments were censored on the post.](http://removeddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/)

2. The post is one of the most popular posts on r/bitcoin ever, with over 1,000 comments. It stands now at zero upvotes, which shows how disliked it was.

3. Theymos suggests that Bitcoin XT does not have consensus and therefore can't be Bitcoin. His reasoning in the post is that Bitcoin core developers Wladamir, Greg, and Pieter are opposed to it. Greg and Pieter are cofounders of Blockstream.

>**About XT**
>
>r/Bitcoin exists to serve Bitcoin. XT will, if/when its hardfork is activated, diverge from Bitcoin and create a separate network/currency. Therefore, it and services that support it should not be allowed on r/Bitcoin. In the extremely unlikely event that the vast majority of the Bitcoin economy switches to XT and there is a strong perception that XT is the true Bitcoin, then the situation will flip and we should allow only submissions related to XT. In that case, the definition of "Bitcoin" will have changed. It doesn't make sense to support two incompatible networks/currencies -- there's only one Bitcoin, and r/Bitcoin serves only Bitcoin.
>
>If a hardfork has near-unanimous agreement from Bitcoin experts and it's also supported by the vast majority of Bitcoin users and companies, we can predict with high accuracy that this new network/currency will take over the economy and become the new definition of Bitcoin. (Miners don't matter in this, and it's not any sort of vote.) This sort of hardfork can probably be adopted on r/Bitcoin as soon as it has been determined that the hardfork is not absolutely against the spirit of Bitcoin (inflating out-of-schedule, for example). For right now, there will always be too much controversy around any hardfork that increases the max block size, but this will probably change as there's more debate and research, and as block space actually becomes more scarce. I could see some kind of increase gaining consensus in as soon as 6 months, though it would have to be much smaller than the increase in XT for ~everyone to agree on it so soon.
>
>There's a substantial difference between discussion of a proposed Bitcoin hardfork (which was previously always allowed here, even though I strongly disagree with many things posted) and promoting software that is programmed to diverge into a competing network/currency. The latter is clearly against the established rules of r/Bitcoin, and while Bitcoin's technology will continue working fine no matter what people do, even the attempt at splitting Bitcoin up like this will harm the Bitcoin ecosystem and economy.
>
>**Why is XT considered an altcoin even though it hasn't broken away from Bitcoin yet?**
>
>Because it is intentionally programmed to diverge from Bitcoin, I don't consider it to be important that XT is not distinct from Bitcoin quite yet. If someone created a fork of Bitcoin Core that allowed miners to continue mining 25 BTC per block forever, would that be "Bitcoin" even though it doesn't split from the Bitcoin currency/network quite yet? (I'd say no.)
>
>**Can I still talk about hard fork proposals on r/Bitcoin?**
>
>Right now, not unless you have something really new and substantial to say.
>
>After this sticky is removed, it will be OK to discuss any hardfork to Bitcoin, but not any software that hardforks without consensus, since that software is not Bitcoin.
>
>**If XT is an altcoin then why aren't sidechains or Lightning altcoins?**
>
>r/Bitcoin is about the Bitcoin currency and network. Lightning allows you to move the Bitcoin currency. Sidechains are on-topic in general because they are a possibly-useful addition to the Bitcoin network. It is possible that some specific sidechains might not be on-topic -- this isn't clear to me yet.
>
>XT is programmed to create a separate currency and network, so it is not Bitcoin.
>
>**How do you know that there is no consensus?**
>
>Consensus is a high bar. It is not the same as a majority. In general, consensus means that there is near-unanimity. In the very particular case of a hardfork, "consensus" means "there is no noticeable probability that the hardfork will cause the Bitcoin economy to split into two or more non-negligible pieces".
>
>I know almost for certain that there is no consensus to the change in XT because Bitcoin core developers Wladamir, Greg, and Pieter are opposed to it. That's enough to block consensus. And it works both ways: if Gavin and Mike are strongly opposed to Pieter's BIP, then this will also block consensus on that BIP.
>
>Other than the core devs, big Bitcoin companies (especially Coinbase, BitPay, and exchanges) could block consensus, as could large groups of average users who are collectively capable of making reasonable arguments and exerting economic force (probably not just random unknown people complaining about nothing).
>
>Even though consensus is such a high bar, I think that in practice any hardfork that gets consensus among the Bitcoin Core devs and makes it into Bitcoin Core has a good chance of succeeding. But again, the developers would just be spearheading the effort, and many others could block them if necessary.
>
>**But with such a high bar, 8 MB blocks will be impossible!**
>
>If consensus can never be reached on one particular hardfork proposal, then the hardfork should never occur. Just because you want something doesn't mean that it's ever reasonable for you to hijack Bitcoin from the people who don't want it, even if your side is the majority (which it isn't in this case). This isn't some democratic country where you can always get your way with sufficient politicking. Get consensus, live without the change, or create your own altcoin.
>
>Hard forks are supposed to be hard. While some hard forks will probably be necessary in the long run, these hard forks will need to have consensus and be done properly or Bitcoin will die due to the economy being constantly shattered into several pieces, or as a side-effect of forcing through technically unsound changes that the majority of experts disagree with (like XT's 8MB block size).
>
>**Don't most experts want 8 MB blocks soon?**
>
>Not by any reasonable idea of "most experts" I can think of. For example, among people with expert flair on /r/Bitcoin, AFAIK any large near-term increase is opposed by nullc, petertodd, TheBlueMatt, luke-jr, pwuille, adam3us, maaku7, and laanwj. A large near-term increase is supported by gavinandresen, jgarzik, mike_hearn, and MeniRosenfeld. (Those 12 people are everyone with expert flair.)
>
>I've heard concerns that some experts who oppose any large near-term increase have conflicts of interest. But many of them have been expressing the same concerns for years, so it's unlikely that any recent possible conflict of interest is influencing them. Also, if they believed that increasing the max block size would help Bitcoin as a whole, what reason would they have to prevent this? I don't see the incentive.
>
>We don't need to trust the above list of experts, of course. But I for one have found the conservative position's arguments to be much more convincing than the huge-increase position's arguments. It's not reasonable to say, "You know a lot more than I do, and I don't see any fault in your arguments, but you must be trying to trick me due to this potential conflict of interest, so I'm going to ignore you."

Theymos goes on the cite the largely debunked email that supposedly came from Satoshi Nakamoto as evidence for his policies and says that if 90% of r/Bitcoin users disagree, 90% should leave.

>Also, someone who could be Satoshi posted here. This email address was actually used by Satoshi before he left, and the email apparently did come from that email address legitimately (not a spoof). Whether he's actually Satoshi or not, I agree with what he's saying.

>If 90% of r/Bitcoin users find these policies to be intolerable, then I want these 90% of r/Bitcoin users to leave. Both r/Bitcoin and these people will be happier for it. I do not want these people to make threads breaking the rules, demanding change, asking for upvotes, making personal attacks against moderators, etc. Without some real argument, you're not going to convince anyone with any brains -- you're just wasting your time and ours. The temporary rules against blocksize and moderation discussion are in part designed to encourage people who should leave r/Bitcoin to actually do so so that r/Bitcoin can get back to the business of discussing Bitcoin news in peace.

user/MeniRosenfeld/ responds in a popular comment to argue that [discussion of forks is an integral part of Bitcoin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/cu6udfe?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

>...the parent post explaining theymos' policy makes no sense to me...the possibility of forking is an integral part of Bitcoin. As long as Bitcoin-XT has non-negligible support as the true Bitcoin implementation, even with nothing resembling unanimous consensus, it is a part of what Bitcoin is, and of course is on topic on a Bitcoin subreddit.
>
>Even if for some reason we take a purist approach that Bitcoin = Bitcoin Core, I'd imagine that most posts about Bitcoin-XT would compare it in some way to Bitcoin Core, and as such are on-topic (just like a post comparing Bitcoin and Litecoin would be on topic).
>
>I'm considering upgrading the above to a post, but honestly, since it includes a discussion of Bitcoin-XT, I'm not even sure it passes the moderation rules...

u/tsontar writes that the [subreddit should change its name to r/bitcoincore](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/cu5ki4j?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)if it will not allow discussion of competing implementations.

>Please change this sub to r/bitcoincore if that's all that will be discussed here.
>
>Calling it r/bitcoin but banning discussions about alternative clients and consensus rules is misleading.
>
>There will be a lot of new clients in the coming years and one would expect r/bitcoin to be the place where cross client issues would be discussed.

u/Petersurda, who is neutral on the blocksize question, p[oints out that the majority of people on the subreddit disagree with these policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/cu5g4xp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) and that there is clearly a double standard on the position of forks, since there had been hard forks in the past.

>What I find interesting is that it looks like the majority of this subreddit readers has a different idea about what this subreddit should be about than the moderators, judging on the downvotes they get in this thread. To me that indicates a fail. The mods are basically shooting themselves in the foot, no matter how they defend it.
>
>I also find it curious that hard forks shouldn't be discussed. What about bitcoin-core 0.8 which caused an unintentional hard fork, or spv miners which caused a hard fork last month?
>
>What about the other features of bitcoin-xt like relaying double spends and allegedly better performance?
>
>What about other suggestions for block size increase, even from opponents of the approach of bitcoin-xt, like Pieter's recent BIP?
>
>Due to these inconsistencies, I find the reasoning of the mods irrational. They do not appear to have been thought through.
>
>I personally do not have a strong opinion regarding the block size. In cases like this, I prefer experimenting to talking, therefore I disagree the block size increase in bitcoin-xt is a bad thing. I don't know if I'll switch to it but now this option has been made easier.

>It's really a shame that Theymos feels too strongly about this subject to allow for debate to occur. The topic is clearly about the future of BITCOIN (calling XT an altcoin is ridiculous, clinging to semantics at best). This topic deserves to be allowed to be hashed out, and banning further discussion of it is a gross disservice to the community.
>
>It's censorship. It is incorrect that this is moderation to make the community a good one. I can only assume this clear censorship will catalyze a mass migration to an open platform that allows relevant Bitcoin topics to be discussed.

>I haven't picked a horse in this fight, but if Theymos is an indication on the right and wrong side of this fight, then I've just been pushed that much closer to supporting XT.

The first comic listed references things Theymos himself said in the past in favor of raising the block size and suggests he may have been paid off by Blockstream to pretend otherwise.

#### 17 August 2015

[The *Not Bitcoin XT* spoof node is released.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1154520.0) The purpose of the node is to deceive Bitcoin XT nodes, prevent correct detection of Bitcoin XT adoption, and cause premature forks for anyone trying to support BIP101.

>This version is indistinguishable from Bitcoin XT 0.11A except that it will not actually hard fork to BIP101, yet appears on the p2p network as Bitcoin XT 0.11A replete with features, yet at a consensus level behaves just like Bitcoin Core 0.11. If it is used to mine, it will produce XT block versions without actually supporting >1MB blocks.
>
>Running this version and/or mining with XT block versions will make it impossible for the Bitcoin XT network to detect the correct switchover and cause a premature fork of anyone foolish enough to support BIP101 without wide consensus from the technical community.
>
>It prevents correct detection of Bitcoin XT adoption in the wild since usage will be known to have been tampered with and thus all statistical data gathered by getnodes can only be considered unreliable.

#### 19 August 2015 

/r/bitcoin moderator /u/jratcliff63367 makes a post to [*Let’s Talk Bitcoin titled “Confessions of an /r/bitcoin moderator.”*](https://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/confessions-of-an-r-bitcoin-moderator)

He observes that r/bitcoin is a centralized communication platform that is being used to push narratives.

>When /u/theymos decided to use his centralized authority of /r/bitcoin to stifle all debate and discussion of bitcoin-xt, he violated a core principle. As a decentralized peer-to-peer network, any point of centralized control is problematic.
>
>Even though I am, for the moment, a moderator of /r//bitcoin, I hold that position solely at the discretion of its owner /u/theymos. He can remove me at any moment, and this is his right.
>
>This one single person holds absolute centralized control of the two largest communications platforms for the community to discuss the future and evolution of bitcoin.
>
>This is both a difficult and simple problem to solve at the same time. It is difficult in that the two largest forums for discussion of bitcoin are under the centralized control of a single individual. He exercises absolute power of what is, or is not, allowed to be discussed; including complete and total censorship power over the narrative in the two largest media outlets.
>
>On the other hand, anyone can move to another forum, or sub-reddit, with the click of a mouse. So simple, yet so difficult at the same time. How do you get 150,000 people to move to another sub-reddit or message forum? It’s not easy, but that is the only solution forward if the community wishes to continue a discussion about the future of bitcoin in a more open and transparent fashion.

He then argues that Theymos is wrong about his policy of calling Bitcoin XT an altcoin:

>I want to clarify some misconceptions which have been fostered over the past few days. The /r/bitcoin sub-reddit has a long history of not allowing posts about alt-coins. In general this hasn’t been super controversial.
>
>Since /r/bitcoin has a long history of removing posts on alt-coins, /u/theymos took a very strong stance that bitcoin-xt is ‘just another alt-coin’, ‘no different than dogecoin’. He first posted this to the private moderator mail and, later, posted it as a public policy for all to see.
>
>I am here to say this, loud and clear, and unequivocally, he is wrong. Either he doesn’t see the distinction, or he does, but doesn’t care.
>
>For whatever reason /u/theymos is profoundly against bitcoin-xt, or any increase in blocksize in general. This is his opinion. And, there are probably some valid arguments to be made on this point. The problem is, rather than sharing his opinion and engaging in the debate, he has shut down all debate by censoring the top two forums where the bitcoin community discusses these topics.

The entire article is worth reading but for space I've left much of it out. He closes by asking people to debate the block size openly, not through censorship.

>Bitcoin-xt is not a ‘threat’ to bitcoin. It it is an option, a choice, a candidate to be voted on. One where the community can vote on which features they want to see in bitcoin, versus those which they do not.
>
>The future of bitcoin is not in the hands /u/theymos, or any particular developer. The future is what we, as an informed community, decide as a whole. If you want to support 1mb blocks then, great, argue that point and vote by running that version of the client software but, if you want to see bitcoin scale, then do so by voting for a client which enables those rules.

SlushPool announces it is [suspending voting on BIP 101 after a DDos attack.](https://slushpool.com/news/update-bip101-voting-disabled-because-of-ddos-attack/)

They receive an extortion letter saying the attack would continue until they stop supporting Gavin Andresen's Bitcoin XT, per the [MIT Technology Review.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2015/09/08/166310/allegations-of-dirty-tricks-as-effort-to-rescue-bitcoin-falters/)

>Alena Vranova, director of SatoshiLabs, said the company received a message saying that the attack would end once it turned off the ability for customers to declare support for Andresen’s idea. SatoshiLabs was forced to comply with that demand because the attack was powerful enough to cause connectivity problems for some Slush Pool miners. “This is a destructive behavior,” says Vranova. “I would admire someone who stands out, explains, and promotes his idea. This is just cowardly.”

#### 29 August 2015

Ten days after his anti-censorship post on Let’s Talk Bitcoin, former /r/bitcoin moderator /u/jratcliff63367 announces that he has been [removed from his role.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin_uncensored/comments/3iwzmk/so_long_and_thanks_for_all_the_fish/) In the thread, /u/theymos chimes in to explain why he removed jratcliff:

>He was going beyond just expressing a reasonable opinion. He was being particularly disrespectful and nonconstructive for a long period of time. Disagreement (even loud public disagreement) is fine, but we can’t effectively moderate without some sort of respect and trust between moderators.

/u/jratcliff63367 writes in the thread that he was removed because he suggested the Core developers may be compromised and that [a version of Bitcoin that can only have value flow through side channels would be exactly what governments want.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin_uncensored/comments/3iwzmk/so_long_and_thanks_for_all_the_fish/cuonqqu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

>I mentioned this in another post that I have since deleted. And that post is what, I believe, got me removed as moderator; since /u/theymos emailed me shortly after I made that post. The idea that the 'core-devs' 'control' bitcoin, is clearly very centralized thinking. And, where there is centralization, there is a point of attack.
>
>It is not at all unreasonable to suppose that core-devs have been contacted by the 'spooks' and are applying influence. Crippling bitcoin so that almost all of the value has to flow through side-channels and only large institutions can access the core network would be a great solution to what world governments consider as a major problem.

#### The same day

A Bitcoin XT node operator posts that [more and more nodes are being attacked](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/3iumsr/udp_flood_ddos_attacks_against_xt_nodes/) and that his have been hit there times. He blames the attack on people who don't want Bitcoin XT.

>It would seem that the conflict has taken a nasty turn, and some of the more extreme Core supporters have started just straight out DDoS attacking XT nodes. Not the silly bloom filter CPU exhaustion thing, but actual UDP flood attacks. Looking at a recent drop-off at XTNodes.com, it seems that this has started during the last 24 hours, and one of my nodes was hit three times in that period, on a dedicated IP that only runs a Bitcoin node and nothing else. (Not that they accomplished anything outside of saturating it for ten minutes or so.)
>
>Is this really how some people think they are going to "resolve" the situation? If this continues, I can easily see people starting to declare open season on non-XT nodes, and then we have a war going that no one wants.

Another Bitcoin XT node operator complains the [DDos attacks keep happening and most aren't being discussed online.](
https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/3jg2rt/the_ddoses_are_still_real/)

One XT supporter comments that [this would be criminal in any other industry.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/3jg2rt/the_ddoses_are_still_real/cup2pqu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

>In any other industry, this would be consider industrial terrorism/espionage, and is highly criminal. From an outside perspective it just looks bad.

Mike Hearn writes that the attackers are clearly trying to [stop anyone from running anything but Bitcoin Core](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/3jg2rt/the_ddoses_are_still_real/cupb74s?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) and extorting people.

>The attackers have been telling pools to stop mining BIP 101 voting blocks if they want the attacks to stop. It's very clearly a Russian Bitcoiner who believes that everyone should use Core no matter what.

One more node operator writes that his node is ["constantly DoSed."](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/3jemi9/my_node_is_constantly_dosed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

>My only sword against DoS is changing my MAC address so my ISP assigns new IP. otherwise I would have to turn off my node because my work depends on my internet connection. I think there is more people that need to turn off their nodes because of this DoS attack.

#### 03 September 2015

An owner or representative from chunkhost.com posts in r/Bitcoin that their [customers running Bitcoin XT nodes are under DDOs attack.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3jj2hf/bitcoin_xt_nodes_being_ddosed/)

>We run chunkhost.com and a couple of days ago received a DDOS attack against one of our customers (as we sometimes do). Upon investigation, the customer explained he had been using the server as a bitcoin node for the backend for a bitcoin ATM for over a year with no issue. He just recently switched to XT to show support for BIP 101, and was summarily attacked!

The founder of chunkhost Josh Jones told the [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2015/09/08/166310/allegations-of-dirty-tricks-as-effort-to-rescue-bitcoin-falters/) that the attack was clearly an attack against Bitcoin XT.

>It seemed pretty clear. As soon as he switched, he got attacked,” says Josh Jones, a founder of ChunkHost. “Some people seem to be taking matters into their own hands.

They ask in Reddit if anyone else running Bitcon XT has experienced a DDos attack and [several users confirm.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3jj2hf/bitcoin_xt_nodes_being_ddosed/)

u/ChaosGrid writes that the attacks are at least an [indirect result of the rhetoric from people against Bitcoin XT.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3jj2hf/bitcoin_xt_nodes_being_ddosed/cuppfs7/)

>I think these attacks are an indirect result of the language used by the anti-XT folks, deeming it a hostile fork and dangerous to bitcoin. While there is FUD spread on both sides, the action of censoring XT posts on the major bitcoin sites is unparalleled and makes me think that certain people actually like having 10% of the network getting DDOSed to "save" bitcoin.

>We are open to evaluating all proposals which increase the block size. But we do plan to upgrade around the second week of December, so this will require working solutions in code by then. The only one I’m aware of which currently has working code is BIP 101...
>
>In my view, Bitcoin XT is the best option I’ve seen so far. Not just because it has working code, but also because it has a simple implementation that is easy to understand, the block-size increases seem about right to me, and I have confidence in the people behind the project. My preference at this point would be to have Gavin step up as the final decision-maker on Bitcoin XT, and have the industry move to that solution with help from Mike Hearn, Jeff Garzik and others that wish to do so.

He also says that he has been disapointed in the Bitcoin Core team and that capacity planning is important, growth is not predictable, and they intend to upgrade to Bitcoin XT whether Core agrees or not,.

>We will upgrade regardless of whether Bitcoin Core is updated. Capacity planning is something you should try to get ahead of. Growth can be unpredictable, and I want to remove all blockers to Bitcoin’s success. I’ve been disappointed to see how slow Bitcoin Core has moved on this issue, and we’re open to switching forks.

>If Coinbase promotes XT to customers on coinbase.com and/or switches all of its full nodes to BIP 101 software, then Coinbase is no longer using the Bitcoin currency, and it doesn't belong on r/Bitcoin.
>
>This also applies to bitcointalk.org (where Coinbase would be restricted to the altcoin section). Bitcoin.it and bitcoin.org have similar policies. In fact, Coinbase was already almost removed from bitcoin.org due to your past statements in this matter.

Theymos also writes that people need to listen more to Blockstream's Greg Maxwell and Core developer Wladimir.

>If Coinbase is actually considering doing this, then you need to spend less time reading comments from idiots on r/Bitcoin and more time talking to people who actually know what they're talking about. If you have not had a long conversation with Wladimir or Greg about this issue, then WTF are you even doing?

>We’re not focused on December with our decision, but we still think the block-size limit should be increased,” Palatinus explained. “Sometimes there are already blocks full of valid transactions, and there’s not any particular reason why user experience with bitcoin transactions should be limited because of an arbitrary limit of 1 megabyte.

Mircea Popescu [posts a bounty for the murder of Pieter Wuille](http://trilema.com/2015/theres-a-one-bitcoin-reward-for-the-death-of-pieter-wuille-details-below/) and claims to have 'murdered Bitcoin XT' too.

>The first party to produce a verifiable death certificate for one Pieter Wuille, aka sipa, last known to exist somewhere around KU Leuven in Belgium will receive payment of 1 (one) Bitcoin to any valid* Bitcoin address of his specification.

He says that Pieter Wuillie is pushing a "Gavinism" in supporting Segwit, which is an odd line of reasoning, but indicates an obvious violent opposition to anything he associates with Gavin, XT, etc.

>This can not be emphasized enough : you can not be building any type of business on any sort of Gavinism, because they will not survive on the middle term. It's not just the Bitcoins, that you would have lost had I not murdered "XT". 

He also writes that you don't own Bitcoin unless you run a full Bitcoin node.

>No, "you" don't hold any Bitcoin until and unless you control a full node that has a wallet. If for instance you're "using blockchain.info" then USG has your Bitcoin, and you use them, maybe, sometimes, at their pleasure. Or not. 
Nodes means "fully validating" nodes. The other version, the faux-nodes, the "not really nodes", the "I can't believe it's not a node" SPV nonsense are the ones that require the specification just like when an honest man meets a thief the honest man is Jim and the thief is Jeff the Thief - not the other fucking way around.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong [announces](https://archive.is/PYwTA) they will run Bitcoin XT on their production servers.

Cobra makes a Github issue to [remove Coinbase from the "choose your wallet" page on Bitcoin.org](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1178) to punish them for running a Bitcoin XT node in addition to their Bitcoin Core node.

>Coinbase is now running Bitcoin XT in their production servers. XT is an contentious hard fork attempt that will create a new altcoin and split the community and blockchain should it ever go into effect. If this ever happens, Coinbase's customers may find that they no longer own any actual Bitcoin.
>
>This pull request removes Coinbase from the "Choose your Wallet" page to protect new users from being on the wrong end of a blockchain fork. Bitcoin.org should only promote Bitcoin services. Companies that use XT don't meet this criteria because they support forking off the blockchain and switching to a new incompatible currency without broad consensus.
>
>Bitcoin Core has already announced a road map to address scalability concerns. I don't see why @barmstrong feels the need to try to promote XT in this way. Almost all of the Bitcoin technical community supports the announced road map. It's not like things aren't moving forward

One Github user [comments](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1178#issuecomment-167379700) in support that Coinbase needs to be forced in line.

>ACK. We definitely need to coerce Coinbase into switching back to Bitcoin Core. If we do not take any action, we're setting a dangerous precedent where other wallets and services are allowed to break apart from the consensus.

The issue is on the whole very unpopular thought.

Bitcoin developer [Jameson Lopp comments that Bitcoin XT can become Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1178#issuecomment-167378735) and removing companies before a fork has happened is premature.

>NACK; the potential for forking does not an altcoin make. Until such time as a BIP101 fork occurs, companies running XT are definitely running Bitcoin. If a hard fork does occur, said companies may still be running Bitcoin - it would have to be judged which fork is the winner post-fork. Removing companies as "not running Bitcoin" when no fork has occurred is jumping the gun.

OB1 Cofounder [Brian Hoffman comments:](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1178#issuecomment-167456502)

>This is a god damn experiment on their part. Not compliant with the Bitcoin network? Any service allowing registrations and financial software is subject to their locales regulations and guidelines or they go to jail.

According to developer [Mike Hearn,](https://blog.plan99.net/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7) the attack was a response to Coinbase's decision to run XT.

A rogue /r/bitcoin mod going by the username /u/CensorshipIsTheWorst [leaked the following conversation from the /r/Bitcoin mod-mail:](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3yj7r0/coinbase_censorship/)

>from Aussiehash [M] to /r/Bitcoin sent 1 day ago https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ycayp/brian_armstrong_on_twitter_coinbase_is_now/ I’ve removed this post for now. I’m happy for other mods to reverse or otherwise.
>
>from theymos [M] via /r/Bitcoin to Aussiehash [M] sent 11 hours ago I agree with removing it because it is mainly about XT. However, AFAICT Coinbase is currently still using Bitcoin and should therefore be allowed on /r/Bitcoinfor now in general. coblee said so in the bitcoin.org pull request, and I tend to trust him. (Perhaps Cobra was unaware of coblee’s reliability, or maybe he [IMO reasonably] considered Coinbase too dangerous/incompetent/reckless to list on bitcoin.org even though they are currently using Bitcoin.)

>from StarMaged [M] via /r/Bitcoin to theymos [M] sent 5 hours ago Honestly, it seems to me that until the moment of the split, they are still a bitcoin company. They are just buying/selling two currencies at once instead of one. I am really uncomfortable with the idea that this policy would encourage companies to silently support XT and then only tell us at the last moment. Yeah, sure, remove those posts as altcoin promotion, but people outside of this subreddit should be allowed to make an informed decision without us scaring companies into censoring themselves. I feel that this is where that term “censorship” might actually be relevant, since our actions here on this issue would affect the speech of a company elsewhere out of fear of retaliation from this subreddit. Something to ponder.

A few hours later, /u/colsatre had his moderator position revoked, leading some to speculate that he was the rogue mod. /u/CensorshipIsTheWorst never posted again.

#### 08 January 2016

A thread in r/Bitcoin titled *Scalability issue is a red-herring* argues Bitcoin is a store of value first and by implication suggests we don't need to raise the block size. The thread has 51 comments and zero upvotes.

Theymos comments in agreement and is heavily downvoted.

>If that requires treating bitcoins like Yap stones, that's still better than what we had before Bitcoin.

u/Uber_Nick responds, questioning Theymos on deleting comments he disagrees with.

>Does "better and freer" mean users won't be banned from discussing ideas that are different than yours?

Theymos replies and is heavily downvoted.

>No one is ever banned for discussing ideas that are different than mine. Banning someone for that reason would be completely at odds with my philosophy of moderation.

Seems rational? But when we use the [Removeddit tool,](http://removeddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/404z6b/scalability_issue_is_a_redherring/) we can see 24% of the comments on the entire are removed, most of which appear to have been in response to Theymos' defense of his moderation policies.

[*The Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments*](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf) is published. 

>The Bitcoin blockchain holds great promise for distributed ledgers, but
the blockchain as a payment platform, by itself, cannot cover the world’s
commerce anytime in the near future.

The paper argues that in order to "achieve much higher than 47,000 transactions per second using
Bitcoin requires conducting transactions off the Bitcoin blockchain itself."

Notably, it also argues that the Lightning Network will require block size increases on Bitcoin up to 133mb in order to work properly.

>If all transactions using Bitcoin were conducted inside a network of
micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels
per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require
133 MB blocks (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per
year). Current generation desktop computers will be able to run a full node
with old blocks pruned out on 2TB of storage.

[Chat logs between botneko-chan and Mircea Popescu](http://btcbase.org/log-search?q=%22%20T%22&page=3279) discuss DDos attacking Bitcoin Classic nodes and some possible payment details.

![Popsecu Chat](https://i.imgur.com/YnOVqlA.png)

botneko-chan writes that he will "keep ddosing classic for month" and is also "going to try ddos pool mining it"

Mircea Popescu tells botneko-chan to "post an addy," and says "i'll send you some on the strength of his word."

In order to understand the signifcance of this, we need to know a little about Mircea Popescu.

Mircea Popescu was described in the media at the time as ["one of the better known critics of increasing the block size at all"](https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/bitcoin-leaders-speak-up-block-size) and had earlier threatened to attack attempts at raising the block size: ["my budget to sink this scam exceeds the budget of everyone involved on the supporting side."](http://trilema.com/2015/if-you-go-on-a-bitcoin-fork-irrespective-which-scammer-proposes-it-you-will-lose-your-bitcoins/#selection-83.138-83.229)

Popescu was later [thanked](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eiskr6/i_was_reading_saifedeans_book_and_saw_mircea/) in the popular pop-economics book "The Bitcoin Standard," which argues for a limited block size.

He was also later accused by Gregory Maxwell of [posting child pornpgraphy online,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eiskr6/i_was_reading_saifedeans_book_and_saw_mircea/fctiggk?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) and [threatening to murder people,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eiskr6/i_was_reading_saifedeans_book_and_saw_mircea/fcu3kvi?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) including [Andreas Antonoplous](https://web.archive.org/web/20160503210834/http://www.thecoinfront.com/andreas-antonopolous-threatened-with-murder-over-twitter/)

Prominent Bitcoin Twitter personality and small-block supporter BitcoinError Log, who in the coming years played a large role in the UASF effort to resist Segwit 2x writes years later that he learned alot from Mircea and that [he owed a lot of his actions defending against Segwit 2x to him.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eiskr6/i_was_reading_saifedeans_book_and_saw_mircea/fcwqv16?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

>The current attack is the latest to show that a simple disagreement over scalability has descended into chaos and has brought to surface criminal elements within our community. The disagreement follows recommendations to increase capacity to 2MB as an emergency measure to release the pressure on transactions which are currently operating at maximum capacity with blocks being full.

Bitcoin.com reports that some of their [Bitcoin Classic nodes were hit with a DDos attack](https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-classic-targeted-by-ddos-attacks/) that led to a server being shut down by their ISP for several hours.

CTO of Bitcoin.com, Emil Oldenburg, wrote that the purpose of the attack was the intimidate people from running the Bitcoin Classic software.

>The purpose of this attack is to intimidate anyone running Bitcoin Classic. It’s the same modus operandi we saw with Bitcoin XT. This comes at a time when miners have started to mine Bitcoin Classic blocks and already have way more support than XT ever had. Someone, or some people, are buying DDOS attacks towards Classic in an attempt to stop the growth of Classic nodes and blocks. Some Core developers, and Adam Back, have stated that ‘Bitcoin is not a democracy’, while this description is correct for the current governance model; with the censorship, character assassinations, attacks against anyone who disagrees with the party line and sabotage against free choice, the current governance is more similar to North Korea.

>The attacks began to target the F2Pool Bitcoin mining pool almost immediately after the F2Pool team announced their decision to “test” Bitcoin Classic by launching a subpool in which miners can mine Bitcoin Classic blocks.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says the [Core developers may be the biggest risk to Bitcoin](https://blog.coinbase.com/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf#.qaggpgms9) in an article about the Satoshi Roundtable.

>In my opinion, perhaps the biggest risk in bitcoin right now is, ironically, one of the things that has helped it the most in the past: the bitcoin core developers.

He writes about the stubborness, immaturity and technocratic agenda and beliefs of the developers on display at the roundtable. 

>The conversations initially focused on various compromises to kick the can down the road on scalability. But as the conversations went on, I became less and less concerned about what short term solution we pick because I realized we all had a much bigger problem: the systemic risk to bitcoin if Bitcoin Core was the only team working on bitcoin.
The core team contains some very high IQ people, but there are some things which I find very concerning about them as a team after spending some time with them last weekend.
>
>1. Some of them show very poor communication skills or a lack of maturity — this has hurt bitcoin’s ability to bring new protocol developers into the space.
>
>2. They prefer ‘perfect’ solutions to ‘good enough’. And if no perfect solution exists they seem ok with inaction, even if that puts bitcoin at risk.
>
>3. They seem to have a strong belief that bitcoin will not be able to scale long term, and any block size increase is a slippery slope to a future that they are unwilling to allow.
>
>Even though core says they are ok with a hard fork to 2MB (they have it on their own roadmap, just very far in the future), they refuse to prioritize it. They prefer to withhold something that could help the network now, because they don’t trust the community to make educated decisions in the future. They view themselves as the central planners of the network, and protectors of the people. They seem ok with watching bitcoin fail, as long as they don’t compromise on their principles.

According to Armstrong, it was both "negligent" and revealing of the Core team's "motivations" for them to allow the blocks to become so congested.

>The network today, with 70% of blocks full, is already experiencing congestion issues and backlogs. Any reduction in hashing power will exacerbate the problem.
>
>The fact that bitcoin core has allowed the network to reach this point is incredibly negligent, and I think says a lot about their motivations and competency as a team. There is no reason to roll the dice and see if this failure scenario comes to fruition.

Armstrong then argues that Bitcoin should upgrade to 2mb block sizes as soon as possible.

>The first step is that we need to do an immediate upgrade to 2MB blocks. This is the most realistic short term scaling solution that will buy us time. My belief is that we will either be doing this upgrade now (when there is sufficient lead time for everyone to prepare), or we will be doing it in the midst of an emergency down the road. It is not a matter of if, but when. 

He concludes that Bitcoin will ultimately need an entirely new developer team that is willing to work with the community to scale rather than make technocratic decisions for everyone and that it is irresponsible not to run Bitcoin Classic.

>Long term, we need to form a new team to work on the bitcoin protocol. A team that is welcoming of new developers to the community, willing to make reasonable trade offs, and a team that will help the protocol continue to scale.

>At this point it would be irresponsible not to upgrade to Bitcoin Classic. We need to solve the immediate scaling issue we are facing.

In the postscript, he says that r/Bitcoin is heavily censoring content about raising the block size.

>There continues to be rampant censorship on https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin regarding this debate, which is unfortunate. I continue to encourage everyone to move to https://www.reddit.com/r/btc as an alternative that is censorship free.

A post in r/bitcoin claims that 51% of Bitcoin Classic nodes are hosted on AWS. The point of the post is to demonstrate that Bitcoin Classic is conducting a sybill attack against the network, but Bitcoin Classic node operators claim the ongoing DDos attacks have [forced operators to use the cloud service](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/499bai/51_of_bitcoin_classic_nodes_hosted_on_aws/d0q2glj?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) because it withstands the attacks better.

>The ddos causes this centralization. A node running on Google or Amazon cloud can stand up better to ddos. Nodes on smaller VPS providers are vulnerable to ddos. A home node is great but some people want to make more bandwidth available to the network.

>Yes, I moved my classic node from my home connection this weekend because of the ddos going on.

>Yup. I've had no problems with my Azure nodes, but my home connection has been targeted several times. I'm testing VPN services so I can continue to run at home, however.

>In direct response to the DDoS attack. Classic-cloud has been instrumental in diluting the attack.

On the same day, another post in r/bitcoin claims that Bitcoin Classic node counts [have been dropping](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/49a0fs/bitcoin_classic_support_plateaus_and_drops_down/d0q92ki/?context=3) suggesting the attacks have had a cooling effect on node operators running Classic.

>After running for over a year, I had to shutdown all of these projects because the Bitcoin nodes were being DDoS'd, affecting my paying client base.

Bitcoin.org co-owner 'Cobra' posts on Github that [he wants to update the Bitcoin whitepaper](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1325#issue-163491953) because it confuses people. The implication is clear by the timing. Cobra did not want people to think that Bitcoin was meant to scale on-chain.

>I've been noticing that the Bitcoin paper at https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf is getting a lot of traffic (mainly from people searching for "bitcoin paper", or probably seeing it cited by other papers). Almost all the people reading the paper are probably reading it for the first time, and using it as a learning resource. However since the paper is so outdated, I believe it doesn't do a good job anymore of giving people a firm understanding of Bitcoin (at least the modern version). There is no mention of things like pools, and the Privacy and SPV sections could probably be updated.
>
>The paper links to bitcoin.org, but I feel like the Bitcoin described in the paper and the Bitcoin described on bitcoin.org are starting to diverge. At some point, I think the paper will start to do more harm than good, because it tricks people into believing they understand Bitcoin. I have seen people promote toxic and crazy ideas, and then cite parts of the paper in an effort to justify it. Academics are also regularly citing the paper and basing some of their reasoning and arguments on this outdated paper.
>
>Normally issues like this in other projects would be solved by regularly updating the learning resources, and documents, such as producing new editions or versions of the document to keep it in line with the current status of the project. I'd be interested to know the community's thoughts and opinions on this issue, since I know it's likely to be a divisive but some rational debate would be good, because it could become more of a problem in the future.
>
>There are already a few different versions of the paper out there, so Satoshi has already set the precedent that the paper should be updated to reflect the current realities of the software. I believe the paper was always designed to be a high level overview of the current reference implementation, and that we should update it now that the paper is outdated and the reference implementation has changed significantly from 2009.

The thread is heavily downvoted.

A user named Rudd-O [replies](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1325#issuecomment-230184015) and is strongly critical. 

>The concept of "amending a paper" written by a first party author by way of a third-party author mangling is absurd, and it is a crime in quite a few jurisdictions.
>
>Morally, I say don't lie to people by mangling the original writeup. It exists where it exists for a reason. Altering the original paper to "update it" is a perversion of the very idea of a published paper. If you want it to be updated, talk to Satoshi. He can publish a second version.
>
>In the meantime, publish an updated paper yourself. Under your name.
>
>Whoever is distributing forged versions of the paper should be prosecuted for plagiarism.

Greg Maxwell calls him a ['pseudonymous armchair provocateur'](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1325#issuecomment-230186527) and suggests that Cobra has a point and that seriuos discussion about changing the whitepaper is needed.

>In this case, Cobra pointed out that many people land on the Bitcoin whitepaper page after searching "bitcoin paper". Presumably, some of these people are just looking for a good background on Bitcoin, and for this purpose they are not that well served by the whitepaper as of its last update because it contains some inaccuracies (and a few things that eight more years of experience has taught us are easily misunderstood). 

He accuses Rudd-O of 'online violence' and refers to Bitcoin.org as Cobra's "own space."

>Here you wax on about censorship yet you see fit to make demands not just on what someone publishes on their own website, but respond with online violence to people who are simply discussing some things you don't like, in their own space. 

Greg is heavily downvoted.

Luke Dashjr [responds in support.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1325#issuecomment-230078395)

>Sounds reasonable as long as it's clear it isn't the original paper. Maybe an updated HTML version, with a clear link to the original at the top?

He is heavily downvoted.

[Theymos replies to the thread as well](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1325#issuecomment-230082608) and suggests the whitepaper be annotated to correct errors Satoshi made and misunderstandings people might have.

>Interesting suggestion. The paper is definitely outdated, and I do often see people saying "just read the whitepaper!" as if the paper is still a good way to learn about Bitcoin. On the other hand, the paper is an important piece of history. It's still an impressive document, even if not the most useful nowadays, explaining most of how Bitcoin works in only a few pages.
>
>Maybe it would be best to stick several pages of errata and explanation to the front of the PDF, but leave Satoshi's pages untouched. Having bitcoin.pdf redirect to an HTML page would also work...

He is heavily downvoted too, and a look at the entire history clearly shows the idea was wildly unpopular.

Miner viaBTC writes an [article](https://imgur.com/a/jbnQ1#N4hiFJU) that asks people to unsubscribe from r/bitcoin because the subreddit is censored by people who want to turn Bitcoin into a settlement layer rather than a payment network like it has always been.

It is reposted to r/bitcoin. Using Removeddit, we can see that 136 comments, over [25% of the total comments on the post, were deleted by moderators!](http://removeddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5w9e8t/viabtc_aka_bitcoin_accelerator_is_telling_people/)

The entire post is worth reading before we look at specific examples of censorship.

>ViaBTC is of the opinion that the current "Bitcoin Core + Blockstream” Bitcoin development team is not taking satisfactory steps to ensure the growth and advancement of Bitcoin in accordance with satoshi's original white paper, and is in fact actively harming the health of the Bitcoin economy by actively stifling efforts to solve some of Bitcoin’s most pressing problems.
>
>The reason why this Transaction Accelerator exists is due to problems created by Bitcoin Core’s inability and unwillingness to deliver any sort of meaningful protocol upgrade over the last several years, against the desires of the Bitcoin community at large. Those who have attempted to deliver the necessary upgrade have been vilified and silenced by Bitcoin Core and their affiliated censored media channels. Average users who dare to disagree are banned and have their comments deleted.
>
>Rather than viewing Bitcoin as a fast, affordable, and reliable payments network, as it has been for years, they aim to transform Bitcoin into what they call “a settlement layer”, defined by high fees, unreliable transactions, and a labyrinth of complex overlays that require third-party trust on top of the basic system.
>
>This development team has further prevented the ability of the Bitcoin community to freely discuss this radical change of direction by tacitly, and in some cases explicitly, supporting censorship of Bitcoin’s largest discussion forums, along with the outright banning of many prominent developers, businesses, and community members who have differences of opinion with Bitcoin Core’s current roadmap. After years of stagnation, stalling, and broken promises, it has become clear that positive change will not come from Bitcoin Core, but rather from the diverse group of alternate development teams that have emerged as a result of Core’s tactics.
>
>The following article cites many specific examples of the rampant censorship on the "r/bitcoin" sub-reddit:

>
>As efforts by the community to resolve these problems have failed, it is necessary to resolve them with a different approach:
>
>By unsubscribing to /r/bitcoin, and subscribing to sub-reddit /r/btc you take a stand against censorship.
By running an alternate implementation, such as Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Classic, you are casting a vote against the current development team.
>
>There are currently several other cryptocurrencies which perform better than Bitcoin, have more features than Bitcoin, have a more receptive and open development team than Bitcoin, and have a better upgrade path than Bitcoin. The only remaining qualities that Bitcoin has over these other cryptocurrencies are its first-mover advantage and its pre-existing network of users and infrastructure. If these qualities are not preserved, Bitcoin will continue to lose market share to competing cryptocurrencies.
>
>The current Bitcoin Core developers are rapidly eroding this last advantage with poor design choices, a failure to understand basic economic principles, and promoting censorship through their support of censored discussion forums and their vilification of forums committed to free speech.

>An influential core developer announces a bug in a bitcoin client in the most public place possible, after the bug has already been fixed but has not been pushed out yet, for the sole purpose of causing as much damage as possible.

Then the main bitcoin subreddit fills with every single post cheering that an attack has happened on the network and that it is great.

>I am Matt Corallo, a long-time developer of Bitcoin (around the 10th publicly recorded individual to contribute to the Bitcoin codebase), an expert on Bitcoin's operation, vocal Bitcoin advocate, and strong proponent of the availability of a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Product (ETP).
>
>I have very grave concerns with the proposed rules for the maintaining of Bitcoin deposits and the lack of consumer protection in the event of Bitcoin Network rule changes in the current filings.
>
>As described in the S-1 filing for the "Bitcoin Investment Trust" (BIT), a "permanent fork" of Bitcoin may occur when two groups of users disagree as to the rules which define the system (its "consensus rules"). More specifically, such a "permanent fork" is likely to occur when one group of users wish to make a change to Bitcoin's consensus rules, while another group does not. This leads to two cryptocurrencies, and may lead to significant ambiguity around which should be referred to as "Bitcoin".

An issue is opened on Github to [delist any company that signed the NYA.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1753) Cobra writes that they should [delist BitPay and Coinbase, any of their products, and issue an alert for potential customers.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1753#issuecomment-332300306)

>I believe the main economic actors involved in this NYA takeover attempt (Coinbase & Bitpay) are still very committed to going through with it. Nothing has changed in the last month.
>
>For now, let's just remove any mention of Coinbase and Bitpay (and their associated products), and put out an alert telling users to BEWARE of Coinbase and Bitpay because they plan on switching over to something that we believe isn't actual Bitcoin. The alert can have instructions telling users how to get their BTC off these services and recommend alternative companies that are committed to using the real Bitcoin.

#### 28 September 2017

Cobra opens a Github issue for Bitcoin.org labeled [*Add Segwit2x Safety Alert.*](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1824) The alert ostensibly warns users of hostile companies, but the list includes most of the oldest, most successful Bitcoin companies, and the real goal seems to be to scare or punish these companies for their stance on Segwit 2x.


>This adds a new alert warning users about storing any BTC in Coinbase, Bitpay and Xapo. These companies continue ahead with their plan to hard fork away from consensus, and so this alert is necessary to make sure users are informed enough about the incoming threat.
>
>Thoughts? Feedback? I've tried to keep it fairly short, and I don't want this to grow into a huge complex document full of a million different things. I think the key part is to just tell people to get their coins off these dangerous services, and I think this alert accomplishes that pretty well.
>
>I've made this into a red alert because I think this incoming hard fork is possibly the greatest threat to Bitcoin, so a red warning is necessary to catch people's attention. I want as many as possible to know what these insidious companies are planning so we can prevent them quietly pushing it through. Raising awareness is key. I'm going to be suspicious of anyone changing this document in such a way as to make the issue seem like less of a danger and trying to "tone it down" without clear well thought out reasons.

The proposal is heavily downvoted on Github. Longtime Bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Vorhees [comments on Twitter:](https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/918126175758598146)

OB1 Cofounder points out that [Adam is the CEO of Blockstream,](https://twitter.com/Satoshi_N_/status/915459435203584000) one of the most funded companies in Bitcoin.

The founder of Blockchain.com, Peter Smith, says that he and others on Adam's enemy list [have spent years growing Bitcoin adoption before it was ever financially or socially profitable.](https://twitter.com/OneMorePeter/status/915508207199670272?s=20)

Theymos posts on a Github issue asking for people to [post information about companies](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1835) that should be added to the list of companies to warn people about on Bitcoin.org.

Luke Dashjr responds that the Mike Belshe (CEO BitGo) was ["peddling dishonest 2X propaganda"](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1835#issuecomment-335298798) because he posted that the [2bm block increase was simple and safe to do.](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-October/000369.html)

>The 2x part of Segwit2x is, by any measure, a simpler technical
change.   I would never say that changes carry no risk, but as far as risk
goes, this one is really small.

>It's a good opportunity now to just move to 2mb blocks, and there are
literally no technical objections left.

Despite the unpopularity of Bitcoin.org's Segwit Safety Alert proposal, they [post on their blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20171028193101/https://bitcoin.org/en/posts/denounce-segwit2x) their intentions to activate the alert in the coming days, along with a blacklist of companies that includes Coinbase, BitPay, Bitcoin.com, Blockchain.com, BTC.com and more. 

They also list 'guidelines' for companies to be removed from the list. The entire article is shared below.

>On 2017-10-11 at noon (UTC), Bitcoin.org is planning to publish a banner on every page of the site warning users about the risks of using services that will default to the so-called Segwit2x1 (S2X) contentious hard fork. S2X companies will be called out by name. To ensure that we only warn users against companies that will actually put user deposits at risk, we urge all companies to publicly clarify their stance before the above date, either by a highly-visible public statement or by commenting on Bitcoin.org issue #1835 (or by doing both).
>
>In particular, we need to know that:
>
>- The company will not under any circumstances list “Segwit2x” as “BTC” and/or “Bitcoin”. Note that Bitcoin is not ruled by miners, and miner actions cannot be used as a justification to redefine Bitcoin.
>
>- The company will not by default do anything that would deprive users of their bitcoins (by eg. using S2X software without addressing replay attacks2, selling user bitcoins automatically, crediting BTC deposits only as S2X deposits, etc.). Providing access to S2X-coins is acceptable, however.
>
>- The company will continue to provide normal service to Bitcoin (ie. non-S2X) users.
>
>Although bitcoin.org condemns contentious hard fork attempts such as S2X, we consider it tolerable for companies to support S2X in ways that do not contradict the above three points, such as by supporting both Bitcoin and S2X simultaneously as separate cryptocurrencies.
>
>By default, we will be using the following list of companies known to support S2X in our warning:

>1. “SegWit2x” has nothing to do with SegWit. SegWit is already activated, and was supported by an entirely different set of people.
>2. S2X claims to have replay protection, but their version requires extra manual steps in order to prevent loss of BTC. If you use S2X software without careful engineering, you are likely to lose any associated BTC.


The article is notable for many reasons, particularly the claim that "Segwit2x has nothing to do with Segwit."

A hilariously (but accurately) titled article on BitcoinInsider says ["Bitcoin.org Plans to “Denounce” Almost All Bitcoin Businesses and Miners."](https://www.bitcoininsider.org/article/7661/bitcoinorg-plans-denounce-almost-all-bitcoin-businesses-and-miners)

[Blockstream Chief Strategy Officer Samson Mow tags the New York Department of Financial Services on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/916491407270879232?s=20) and asks if Coinbase is breaking any rules and engaging in fraud in supporting Segwit 2X.

> Is @coinbase breaking the terms of the #BitLicense? Endorsing 2x fork definitely raises safety concerns. @NYDFS

He [asks if the regulatory body has given approval](https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/916492211700690945?s=20) for Coinbase signing the New York Agreement.

> Did @NYDFS superintendent give prior written approval for Coinbase to sign #NYA?

The threat is clear: if you support Segwit 2X, Blockstream will use state regulatory bodies to punish you.

[The Segwit Safety Alert activates on Bitcoin.org.](https://web.archive.org/web/20171029022533/https://bitcoin.org/en/) A red banner stating *Beware of Bitcoin's possible incompatibility with some major services* appears on every page.

![Segwit Safety Alert](https://i.imgur.com/Ghe8T21.png)

The linked article is shared in full below.

> **Summary**
>
>A subsection of the Bitcoin economy including prominent businesses such as Coinbase, Xapo, and BitPay have signed an agreement to adopt and implement a contentious hard fork of Bitcoin sometime in November. A hard fork is a backwards incompatible change to the Bitcoin network. This hard fork is not supported by the majority of the Bitcoin users and developers and is therefore a contentious hard fork. By adopting this hard fork, we believe the supporters of this agreement are shifting their users to an alternative currency (an altcoin) which is incompatible with Bitcoin.
>
>The signatories of this agreement wrongly believe that the currency created by adopting this contentious hard fork will eventually become Bitcoin. Therefore storing any BTC on services such as Coinbase, Bitpay and Xapo is strongly not recommended. By storing BTC on these services, you could find that after the hard fork, your BTC has been renamed to something else or replaced entirely with the new altcoin. The best way to ensure that your BTC is protected is to download the latest version of Bitcoin Core and transfer out any BTC stored on services that are a signatory to this agreement. We have listed the businesses supporting this contentious hard fork at the bottom of this document.
>
>For users who aren’t prepared to install Bitcoin Core and go through the lengthy set up process, we recommend a wallet such as GreenAddress, Electrum or TREZOR. Avoid using web wallets like blockchain.info. However users should only use these wallets to store their coins and never perform transactions until well after the hard fork. Any transactions you make on the Bitcoin blockchain can also be replicated and “replayed” on the altcoin chain. If the coins on the contentious hard fork have any value, there will be methods you can use to “split” your coins and have access to them. Pay extra attention to major Bitcoin communication channels and media shortly after the fork so you stay informed.
>
>**Mobile wallets**
>
>Miners in Bitcoin are responsible for transaction ordering through putting transactions into blocks, and collectively creating a chain of these blocks. Most mobile wallets depend on blindly trusting the longest chain produced by the miners in order to safely send and receive transactions. There is considerable mining power supporting the contentious hard fork. A majority of miners have pledged to support the contentious hard fork, therefore the longest chain as seen by most mobile wallets may not be the true block chain. As a result of this, spending money from a mobile wallet during a hard fork is dangerous. You will be vulnerable to many attacks as your wallet is not aware that the miners are breaking the consensus rules on the longest chain.
>
>If the contentious hard fork has failed and the majority of miners have broken their pledge to support the hard fork, it is safe to continue using mobile wallets, however you should check multiple sources of Bitcoin news such as this website, /r/bitcoin, and the Bitcoin Forum to make sure that it’s safe to continue using your particular wallet. As a general rule, you should not perform any transactions during and shortly after the hard fork.
>
>**After the fork**
>
>Blocks may be slower shortly after the hard fork and your transactions will take longer to confirm. You will have to pay a higher transaction fee if your transaction is high priority and you want it confirmed in the next block. You should try to get any important transactions done a few days before the hard fork date. A lot of websites and programs will likely pop up around the time of the hard fork offering to split your Bitcoin so you can have access to both your BTC and to the new altcoin created by this contentious hard fork, you should exercise caution as many of these services are likely to be scams trying to steal your bitcoin. As the hard fork has very little replay protection, most transactions you perform on the Bitcoin network will also be valid on the hard fork network. You should keep this in mind when transacting.
>
>Some services may continue to present and name the altcoin created by this contentious hard fork as Bitcoin. Users should be aware that this new currency is not Bitcoin. Bitcoin can only be changed with the overwhelming consensus of the entire Bitcoin community of individuals, miners, developers and economy. Even when there is overwhelming consensus, unless in an emergency, a hard fork should have at least a year notice period to give enough time for users to upgrade. This hard fork being adopted by the signatories of this agreement achieves none of these things. It is a rushed and hasty upgrade which only has minority community support and has been thoroughly rejected by users and the technical community. As this new altcoin is not Bitcoin, Bitcoin.org will not list wallets and services that present this altcoin as “Bitcoin” or “BTC” to their users after the hard fork. These services have exited the Bitcoin system in a contentious manner and therefore are no longer useful to our visitors.

The article then lists again all the businesses that are supporting Segwit 2x.

Bitcoin Core Twitter and YouTube personality Richard Heart is allegedly [exposed online as an online spammer](reddit.com/r/btc/comments/79y40b/scammer_alert_you_know_the_narcissist_guy_who/) who trained customers to [send millions of unsolicited emails](https://web.archive.org/web/20070821235025/http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-crypto/2003-05/msg00129.html) per day.

>I don't know how this flew under the radar but this is very interesting. Richard Heart was a nobody just a few short months ago. Literally nobody had heard of him until this year. Then all of a sudden out of nowhere he was someone where he himself claimed he was a "thought leader" and started creating these multi hour long videos where he would do nothing but talk shit about big blockers, talk shit about Bitcoin Cash and pump Core and Blockstream as much as possible...They outed him after discovering his past where he was a HUGE SPAMMER, running scams and hanging with murderers and criminals - I KID YOU NOT. He also has a bunch of fake identities including legit fake passports and fake IDs. This guy is not your run of the mill troll. He is a full on scammer with a shady as fck past!

Richard's [first Bitcoin video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgNh43veB3Q) appeared right after the Bitcoin Cash hardfork and strongly critisized big-blockers while supporting Segwit. He would would go on make several popular videos during the height of the scaling wars invovlving BTC, Segwit 2X, and Bitcoin Cash.

Theymos creates a Github issue titled [*Policy to fight against "miners control Bitcoin" narrative.*](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1904#issue-272347583) He expresses his concern as follows and asks that companies sign a pledge aggreeing that Bitcoin consensus rules are not defined by miners in order to be listed on Bitcoin.org.

>With the S2X nonsense, several companies said that miners control Bitcoin. This belief is one of the most dangerous threats to Bitcoin, since if most people think that, then Bitcoin ends up controlled by only a handful of people.
>
>Although this issue is mentioned in a few places on bitcoin.org, I've been thinking that bitcoin.org should somehow act against this more than it is already. For example, maybe bitcoin.org should require that wallets and services sign a very simple pledge that acknowledges that Bitcoin is not ruled by miners in order to be linked from bitcoin.org.

Hilariously, Cobra replies in agreement and [blames this *misconception* on the white paper itself,](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1904#issuecomment-342973983) which begs the question whether the white paper written by Satoshi Nakamoto is correct or they are. He then proposes the paper be rewritten.

>The whitepaper is to blame for all these dangerous beliefs. We seriously need to rewrite it, or produce a completely new whitepaper and call that the Bitcoin whitepaper.

The proposal appears to be wildly unpopular on Github.

[Steam stops accepting Bitcoin payments citing extreme volatility in fee prices.](https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613)

>In the past few months we've seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network. For example, transaction fees that are charged to the customer by the Bitcoin network have skyrocketed this year, topping out at close to $20 a transaction last week (compared to roughly $0.20 when we initially enabled Bitcoin). Unfortunately, Valve has no control over the amount of the fee. These fees result in unreasonably high costs for purchasing games when paying with Bitcoin.

In interview in CoinTelegraph, Bitcoin Core supporter Max Keiser tells people to [use an altcoin, Dash, if they want a payment system.](https://cointelegraph.com/news/steam-stops-accepting-bitcoin-payments-citing-extreme-volatility-fees)

>Dash is emerging as the crypto payment rail while Bitcoin asserts itself as Gold 2.0. I suggest those frustrated by the Bitcoin scaling debate to embrace Dash for payments and leave Bitcoin Core alone to continue working on Gold 2.0.

>Will they also accuse judges and juries of being "retarded" if they rule that the two phrases too similar?

[Stripe ends its support for Bitcoin, citing the block sizes filling up and the lack of utility, and therefore interest, in Bitcoin payments.](https://stripe.com/blog/ending-bitcoin-support) While Stripe states they don't necessarily disagree with the Bitcoin community not raising the block size, they no longer have any reason to work with it.

>Our hope was that Bitcoin could become a universal, decentralized substrate for online transactions and help our customers enable buyers in places that had less credit card penetration or use cases where credit card fees were prohibitive.
>
>Over the past year or two, as block size limits have been reached, Bitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange. Given the overall success that the Bitcoin community has achieved, it’s hard to quibble with the decisions that have been made along the way. (And we’re certainly happy to see any novel, ambitious project do so well.)
>
>This has led to Bitcoin becoming less useful for payments, however. Transaction confirmation times have risen substantially; this, in turn, has led to an increase in the failure rate of transactions denominated in fiat currencies. (By the time the transaction is confirmed, fluctuations in Bitcoin price mean that it’s for the “wrong” amount.) Furthermore, fees have risen a great deal. For a regular Bitcoin transaction, a fee of tens of U.S. dollars is common, making Bitcoin transactions about as expensive as bank wires.
>
>Because of this, we’ve seen the desire from our customers to accept Bitcoin decrease. And of the businesses that are accepting Bitcoin on Stripe, we’ve seen their revenues from Bitcoin decline substantially. Empirically, there are fewer and fewer use cases for which accepting or paying with Bitcoin makes sense.
>
>Therefore, starting today, we are winding down support for Bitcoin payments. Over the next three months we will work with affected Stripe users to ensure a smooth transition before we stop processing Bitcoin transactions on April 23, 2018.

Cobra creates a [Github issue proposing to redo the long-standing informational video on Bitcoin.org.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/2535#issue-343348067) From his comment, we can tell his concern is that users would think that Bitcoin is meant to be used for payments.

>...Claims fees are low which is not necessarily true...
>
>Overall the video just feels... empty. Anyone who watches it won't even get close to a true understanding of what Bitcoin is. It just presents Bitcoin as something slightly better than PayPal. I think it's better if we get a new more up to date video made.

It is notable that nobody had ever complained about the video and the impression it left newcomers with about Bitcoin for years.

Cobra creates a Github issue to discuss [relisting companies that were removed from Bitcoin.org for supporting the 2mb hard fork block size increase.](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/2577) His reasoning is that the delisting *worked* to stop the increase and that these companies are unlikely to try it again.

>After the whole S2X situation, we removed links to many of the businesses that had signed the NYA. The site doesn't mention Coinbase, Xapo, BitPay, BTC.com, etc. I think enough time has passed for us to reconsider the situation. The removal and subsequent period of not linking to them was reasonable, since these companies could have attempted another contentious hard fork shortly after S2X failed, but time has shown that they've completely failed and given up at taking over Bitcoin, and are unlikely to try again.
>
>I believe that attacks on Bitcoin through manipulating large economic actors like Coinbase are a thing of the past. 

Theymos [replies and says they should not be relisted](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/2577) unless they publicly apologize and issue a statement on why they were wrong.

>As far as I can tell, if they don't do anything like that again, it'll be because it's become too difficult now, not because they've learned from it. So I wouldn't re-add them unless they admit their mistakes and in particular acknowledge that Bitcoin is not governed, especially not by miners.'

Blockstream announces their release of the Liquid full node binaries & source code and claims that ["any user can join the #P2P #LiquidNetwork by operating a full node, in order to trustlessly use the #sidechain just like with the #Bitcoin"](https://twitter.com/Blockstream/status/1059886244853886987)

Former co-founder of Blockstrearm Matt Corallo tweets that [this is a lie](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1060101587584991233?s=20).

>Uhhhh, I don't really know how to describe this use of the word "trustless" except "lie". Maybe someone is trying to redefine the word?

Bitcoin.org Co-owner Cobra replies that it is ["very dangerous" for him to call out Blockstream like that.](https://twitter.com/CobraBitcoin/status/1060175987277729792)

[In a comment on a post by Vlad Zamfir,](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/he-imagines-a-world-in-which-crypto-political-and-legal-processes-are-necessarily-going-to-go-fb073b80dd7e) Vitalik Buterin reiterates his belief that failure to raise the block size caused huge damages to Bitcoin:

>I continue to believe that Bitcoin’s *failure* to raise its blocksize by a significant amount in 2016–17 was a travesty and a great violation of many people’s expectations of the protocol, and one that led to more total losses due to excess txfees than the amount lost in the MtGox hack), but this is the argument that you need to be arguing against.

>The kind of "let's be mean just because it's fun" culture exposed by a number of 
@Blockstream folks and their management is a lot of what's wrong with (a small subset) of the Bitcoin culture.

Greg Maxwell [attempts](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Lightning_Network&diff=prev&oldid=930392324) to have Bitcoin XT scrubbed from the Bitcoin Wikipedia page.

>I feel like this subject could get adequately covered as part of a broader article on consensusless decenteralized payment systems, but considering that lightning is the only such system with even moderately wide deployment and that there aren't a lot of secondary sources on the broader idea... that gets in the way of covering it that way.  There are a lot of bit-rotten obscure cryptocurrency articles that should probably be [removed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Bitcoin_XT#Bitcoin_XT_is_long_defunct_and_the_article_is_massively_out_of_date,_should_this_be_deleted?)

Greg Maxwell [threatens](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/f5lm9r/how_roger_ver_escaped_taxes/fhzg431?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) to report Roger Ver to the federal government.

>Surely you didn't conceal your assets... that would have been extraordinarily unwise considering how widely you have bragged about your holdings, especially considering that the IRS will pay whistleblowers up to 30% of the underpayment when the total under-paid is at least $2m. But if you did disclose your assets you should be on the list?
