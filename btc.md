title: The Great Bitcoin Scaling Debate â€” An Annotated Timeline
---

This is a long, working document that is nowhere near complete. I attempt to show through a chronology of primary source material that Bitcoin was systematically hijacked and directed against its original vision of scaling on-chain. 

I do not claim that scaling on-chain is the proper way to scale Bitcoin, only that it was the way *intended* by Satoshi Nakamoto and early Bitcoiners, and that technical and economic arguments against scaling on-chain played a less important role in the eventual outcome than censorship, propaganda, etc.

In a discussion about Digicash on the Cypherpunk Mailing List, 
James A. Donald [critisizes](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) 
the early electronic cash for having high fees.

Creator of the Cypherpunk Mailing List Timothy C. May [responds](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1995/10/cedf031887bdce1f992b8382dc4c27486c61a68bebd117b9bf2818fa2d6dbe23/) 
in agreement.

>I don't know if the "skims off 4% to 10% every time" point accurately
describes how the current Digicash model works, but certainly this will not
fly as a long term rate. So many monetary transactions happen in the course
of business that even a 4% fee _per transaction_ would rapidly wipe out
most of the value.
