I'm a writer, researcher and investor. I work on my own projects and don't advertise them much these days, but in the past, I've been a startup marketing director and an operations executive.

Occasionally, I do consulting for companies, non-profits and private individuals. I usually do these as hobby projects, not as a primary source of income. This includes ghostwriting, research & intelligence, economic advising, marketing strategy and IT, and information management.

I'm interested, in no particular order or completeness, in privacy, Bitcoin, science-fiction, Objectivism, credentialism, education, classical Latin and Greek, economics, capitalism, firearms, publishing, digital archiving, private security, private cities, Indieweb, and cypherpunks.

I live intermittently in the mountains and farm country.

This site has been my online home for a decade and has been published under a variety of URLs. It's written in static HTML and markdown, and built on Jekyll. 

I publish almost everything here first and use the site as my own sort of "social media" feed in addition to longer articles, projects and research that I share.
