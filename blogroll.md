This is an alphabetical list of the blogs I like to read. They're not all frequently updated, and for some, I only read 10% of what they write. I personally know maybe 50% of them.

I don't have a system for what gets added here and what doesn't. Sometimes I'll read one or two articles that I love so much that I'll list the blog here.

- [Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/). I don't read him too often, but see [Matthew Walker's "Why We Sleep" Is Riddled with Scientific and Factual Errors](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/).

- [Chuck Grimmett](http://cagrimmett.com): I always find something useful in Chuck's posts, especially his short [tech tutorials](http://www.cagrimmett.com/tech/2019/02/04/setting-up-mac-from-scratch.html) and [book recommendations](http://www.cagrimmett.com/media/2019/06/12/reading-listening-using.html). See his [cooking blog](https://cooklikechuck.com/) too.

- [Daniel Krawisz](https://krawisz.com): The Emperor of Bitcoin.

- [Gwern Branwen](https://gwern.net). Gwern probably has the only ["About" page](https://www.gwern.net/About) I'd ever recommend reading in full because it's just so good. I don't read his site often because not all the topics interest me, but he goes deeper into things than just about anyone.

- [Jameson Lopp](https://blog.lopp.net/): I haven't always agreed with Lopp's takes on Bitcoin, but I love his work on cryptoanarchy and [privacy.](https://blog.lopp.net/modest-privacy-protection-proposal/) His ["SWATting"](https://blog.lopp.net/reflections-upon-a-swatting/) story is riveting too.

- [Kev Quirk](https://kevq.uk/): I stumbled on this blog somehow one day and have enjoyed his thoughts on privacy, [software](https://kevq.uk/email-is-not-broken/), and [blogging](https://kevq.uk/how-i-optimise-my-website-performance/).

- [Roots of Progress](https://rootsofprogress.org/): See [How early American inventors funded their ventures](https://rootsofprogress.org/how-early-american-inventors-funded-their-ventures) and [Iron: From mythical to mundane](https://rootsofprogress.org/iron-from-mythical-to-mundane)

- [Ryan Kulp](https://www.ryanckulp.com/): See: [Going to jail saved my life.](https://www.ryanckulp.com/jail-saved-my-life/) He's also got good thoughts on marketing and micro acquisitions.

- [Simon Sarris](https://simonsarris.com/): His articles on [building](https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/designing-a-new-old-home-part-1-cf298b58ed41) a new home that doesn't suck are excellent.

- [Tynan](http://tynan.com/): He's just an interesting guy.
